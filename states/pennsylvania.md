# How to Start a Worker Cooperative in Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania offers one of the most supportive legal frameworks for worker cooperatives in the United States. This guide walks you through the essential steps to form and operate a worker cooperative in the Commonwealth.

---

## 1. Quick Summary: What Makes Pennsylvania Unique

Pennsylvania stands out as one of the easier states to form a worker cooperative because the Commonwealth has a dedicated statutory framework specifically for this business type. Under [Title 15, Chapter 77](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/15/00.071..HTM) of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, workers' cooperative corporations are recognized as a distinct legal entity separate from other business forms like traditional corporations and partnerships.

**Key advantages of forming a worker cooperative in Pennsylvania:**

- **Dedicated statutory framework**: Chapter 77 specifically governs workers' cooperative corporations, providing clear legal recognition
- **Strong regional ecosystems**: Philadelphia has emerged as a major hub for cooperative enterprise
- **Multiple technical assistance providers**: Organizations like PACA provide hands-on startup support
- **Growing employee ownership movement**: The Pennsylvania Center for Employee Ownership actively promotes worker ownership statewide

### The Philadelphia Worker Cooperative Scene

Philadelphia has emerged as a hub for cooperative enterprise in Pennsylvania. The city is home to a vibrant ecosystem of worker cooperatives spanning multiple industries:

- **[Home Care Associates](https://philadelphia.coop/phillycoops/)** - A worker-owned home care service provider offering in-home medical care, personal care, and household services with an intensive skill-building training program
- **[Childspace Management Group](https://philadelphia.coop/phillycoops/)** - A worker cooperative whose member-owners are staff of Childspace Day Care Centers, dedicated to creating quality day care jobs
- **[Hivemind](https://philadelphia.coop/phillycoops/)** - A cooperatively-owned construction and fabrication company in West Philadelphia comprised of artists and craftspeople
- **[A&Associates](https://philadelphia.coop/phillycoops/)** - A worker-owned bookkeeping cooperative believing cooperative business is essential to building a better world

The [Philadelphia Area Cooperative Alliance (PACA)](https://philadelphia.coop/) serves as the regional anchor organization - a "co-op of co-ops" representing worker co-ops, food co-ops, housing co-ops, credit unions, energy co-ops, and school co-ops across the Philadelphia region. PACA members collectively represent over 20,000 member-owners within their cooperative network.

As of recent data, Pennsylvania hosts approximately 809 cooperatives with 3.6 million members, generating wages of $488 million for approximately 14,500 employees.

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives in Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania offers two primary legal pathways for forming a worker cooperative. Each has distinct advantages depending on your cooperative's size, goals, and complexity.

### Option A: Workers' Cooperative Corporation (15 Pa.C.S. Chapter 77)

This is Pennsylvania's dedicated statutory framework for worker cooperatives. Under [15 Pa.C.S. § 7703](https://law.justia.com/codes/pennsylvania/2014/title-15/chapter-77), Pennsylvania permits the formation of a workers' cooperative by "five or more farmers, mechanics, laborers or other persons who have incorporated themselves together" for the purpose of carrying on agricultural or commercial business.

**Key Features:**
- Specifically designed for worker ownership
- One member, one vote governance structure (regardless of shares held)
- Corporate name must contain "cooperative" or an abbreviation
- Subject to Chapters 1, 5, and 77 of Title 15
- Patronage rebates and distributions to members are permitted
- Clear governance structure with required board of directors

**Relevant Statutes to Review:**
- [Chapter 71](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/15/00.071..HTM) - Cooperative Corporations Generally
- [Chapter 77](https://law.justia.com/codes/pennsylvania/2014/title-15/chapter-77) - Workers' Cooperative Corporations
- [Chapter 5](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/15/15.HTM) - Corporations (general provisions)
- Chapter 1 - General Provisions

**Best For:** Cooperatives with five or more worker-owners seeking a legally recognized cooperative structure with clear democratic governance requirements built into the statute.

### Option B: Cooperative LLC

A Limited Liability Company (LLC) can be structured as a worker cooperative through a carefully drafted operating agreement that establishes democratic governance and worker ownership principles.

**Key Features:**
- Flexible management structure (can be member-managed or manager-managed)
- Operating agreement governs internal relations under [15 Pa.C.S. § 8815](https://www.palegis.us/statutes/consolidated/view-statute?iFrame=true&txtType=HTM&ttl=15&div=0&chpt=88&sctn=15&subsctn=0) (amended 2024)
- No minimum member requirement
- Pass-through taxation by default (can elect corporate treatment)
- Operating agreement is an internal document (not filed with the state)

**Template Resources:**
- [Democracy at Work Institute (DAWI)](https://becomingemployeeowned.org/learn/structure/llc/) provides template operating agreements for worker cooperative LLCs
- [ICA Group](https://institute.coop/news/guide-worker-cooperative-bylaws-and-operating-agreements) offers guidance on bylaws and operating agreements for democratic firms

**Best For:** Smaller cooperatives, startups with fewer than five members, or groups seeking maximum flexibility in governance design.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Workers' Cooperative Corporation | Cooperative LLC |
|---------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Minimum Members | 5 | 1 (practically 2+) |
| Statutory Recognition | Explicit (Chapter 77) | Through operating agreement |
| Naming Requirement | Must include "cooperative" | Flexible |
| Default Taxation | Corporate | Pass-through |
| Governance Documentation | Articles + Bylaws | Certificate + Operating Agreement |
| Filing Fee | $125 | $125 |
| Cooperative Principles | Statutory protection | Contractual protection |
| Long-term Stability | Built-in protections | Depends on drafting quality |

Given the complexity of cooperative law, consulting with an attorney experienced in cooperative formation is recommended to determine the best structure for your specific situation.

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

Converting an existing business to worker ownership is an increasingly popular succession strategy in Pennsylvania, particularly as baby boomer business owners approach retirement.

### Why Consider Conversion?

- Preserves jobs and keeps businesses local
- Rewards employees who contributed to company success
- Maintains company culture and mission
- Potential tax benefits for selling owners
- Builds community wealth

### Conversion Pathways

**Direct Conversion to Worker Cooperative**
- Current owner sells business directly to employees organized as a cooperative
- Often financed through combination of seller notes, member equity, and cooperative lenders
- Best for smaller businesses (typically under 20 employees)
- May be more feasible for smallest businesses compared to ESOPs

**Hybrid ESOP-Cooperative Conversion**
- Some businesses use ESOP for initial acquisition, then convert to full cooperative
- Takes advantage of ESOP tax benefits for selling owner (1042 rollover)
- May work for businesses seeking gradual transition

### Resources for Conversions

**[Pennsylvania Center for Employee Ownership](https://ownershippennsylvania.org/employee-ownership-businesses/)**
- Provides education and connections for businesses considering employee ownership
- Helps owners understand differences between ESOPs and cooperatives
- Connects businesses with qualified professionals

**[Workers to Owners Collaborative](https://becomingemployeeowned.org/workers-to-owners/)**
- National network supporting business conversions
- Coordinated by Democracy at Work Institute
- Provides tools, practices, and shared learning
- Goal: Expand volume, impacts, and accessibility of conversions nationwide

### Comparison: Worker Cooperative vs. ESOP

| Factor | Worker Cooperative | ESOP |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| Minimum Size | No minimum | Generally 15-20+ employees |
| Tax Benefits to Seller | Limited | Significant (1042 rollover) |
| Democratic Control | Direct (one member, one vote) | Varies by plan design |
| Ongoing Admin Costs | Lower | Higher (annual valuation, trustee fees) |
| Employee Cost | Member buy-in | Shares at no cost to employees |
| Best Fit | Smaller businesses, strong democratic culture | Larger businesses, tax-motivated sellers |

### Steps for Conversion

1. **Feasibility Assessment:** Evaluate whether business is suitable for worker ownership; analyze worker interest
2. **Valuation:** Obtain independent business valuation; negotiate fair price
3. **Structure Selection:** Choose between cooperative and ESOP (or hybrid)
4. **Financing Plan:** Develop capital structure (seller financing, cooperative loans, member equity)
5. **Legal Documentation:** Draft articles, bylaws/operating agreement, and purchase agreement
6. **Employee Education:** Train workers on cooperative governance and ownership
7. **Transition Period:** Implement gradual management transition

### Pennsylvania Success Example

**Advanced Conversion Technology** (Middletown, PA) - Employee-owned since 2021, demonstrating successful transition to employee ownership in Pennsylvania.

## 7. Common Pitfalls in Pennsylvania

### Legal and Structural Issues

**Minimum Member Requirement**
- Chapter 77 workers' cooperative corporations require five or more members
- Smaller groups should consider the LLC structure instead
- Plan for membership growth if starting near the minimum

**Naming Compliance**
- Cooperative corporations must include "cooperative" or an abbreviation in their name
- Failing to include this language will result in filing rejection
- LLCs structured as cooperatives do not have this requirement

**Complex Statutory Framework**
- Must navigate multiple chapters of Title 15 (Chapters 1, 5, 71, and 77)
- Consider consulting with an attorney familiar with Pennsylvania cooperative law
- The [Digital Media Law Project guide](https://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/forming-journalism-cooperative-pennsylvania) notes the law's complexity

**Inadequate Operating Agreement Protections (for LLCs)**
- Future members could potentially remove cooperative provisions
- Solution: Work with experienced attorney to draft protective provisions
- Ensure amendment procedures require supermajority or unanimous consent for core cooperative principles

### Financial Challenges

**Undercapitalization**
- Insufficient startup capital is a leading cause of cooperative failure
- Lack of cash cushion to ride out market fluctuations or management mistakes
- Difficulty purchasing modern equipment
- Build adequate reserves and explore CDFI financing early

**Banking Difficulties**
- Traditional banks often expect a 5%+ individual owner for loan eligibility
- Banks and institutions unfamiliar with cooperative model require explanation
- Work with CDFIs and cooperative lenders familiar with the structure
- [PACA resources](https://philadelphia.coop/iyc/resources/) can help identify cooperative-friendly financial institutions

### Governance Mistakes

**Conflating Ownership and Management**
- Not every decision requires full member vote
- Cooperatives need managers who support cooperative principles and work within democratic structures
- Finding or re-educating managers from traditional organizations is challenging
- Establish clear decision-making levels in governance documents

**"Going Rogue" Problem**
- One member taking unilateral action because cooperatives move slower than sole-owner businesses
- Build patience for democratic process into organizational culture
- Establish clear accountability mechanisms

**Inadequate Operating Agreement/Bylaws**
- Weak or incomplete agreements lead to disputes
- Address member separation scenarios before they arise
- Include clear dispute resolution mechanisms
- Update documents as cooperative evolves

**Skipping Probationary Period**
- Granting full membership too quickly
- Establish reasonable probationary periods (typically 6-12 months)

### Operational Challenges

**Neglecting Business Fundamentals**
- Cooperative structure does not substitute for viable business model
- Product/service quality and customer focus remain essential
- Excessive costs, inadequate marketing, and lack of attention to customers are bad for any business

**Insufficient Member Education**
- Worker-owners need training in governance, finance, and cooperative principles
- Budget for ongoing education and development
- Utilize PACA, USFWC, and other resources for training programs

### Compliance Pitfalls

**Missing New Annual Report Requirements**
- Pennsylvania now requires annual reports (as of January 1, 2025)
- Calendar the appropriate deadline (June 30 for corporations, September 30 for LLCs)
- Budget for $7 filing fee

**Failing to Register for State Taxes**
- Operating without proper tax registrations
- Complete Pennsylvania Online Business Tax Registration through myPATH before commencing business

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: How many people do I need to start a worker cooperative in Pennsylvania?

For a Workers' Cooperative Corporation under Chapter 77, you need at least five members who are "farmers, mechanics, laborers or other persons." If you have fewer than five people, consider forming a Cooperative LLC instead, which has no minimum member requirement. You can later convert to a cooperative corporation as membership grows.

### Q2: What is the difference between a cooperative corporation and a cooperative LLC?

A cooperative corporation is explicitly recognized under Pennsylvania's Chapter 77 statute with specific requirements (five members minimum, "cooperative" in name, one member one vote mandated by law). A cooperative LLC is a standard LLC structured as a cooperative through its operating agreement, offering more flexibility but without dedicated statutory recognition. Both can achieve democratic worker ownership.

### Q3: How much does it cost to form a worker cooperative in Pennsylvania?

Basic formation costs include:
- Articles of Incorporation/Certificate of Organization: $125
- EIN: Free
- State tax registration: Free
- Philadelphia Commercial Activity License (if applicable): Free
- Annual Report (starting 2025): $7/year
- Optional name reservation: $70

Additional costs may include legal assistance, operating agreement drafting, publication fees, and any industry-specific licenses. Budget approximately $500-2,000 for basic formation without legal assistance, or $2,000-5,000 with attorney support.

### Q4: Do I need an attorney to form a worker cooperative?

While not legally required, consulting an attorney familiar with Pennsylvania cooperative law is strongly recommended. The [Digital Media Law Project](https://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/forming-journalism-cooperative-pennsylvania) notes that "because the cooperative law is complex, you may wish to seek the assistance of an attorney." PACA and PaCEO can provide referrals to cooperative-experienced attorneys.

### Q5: How are worker cooperative members taxed in Pennsylvania?

Taxation depends on your legal structure:
- **Cooperative Corporations:** Generally taxed at the corporate level, with patronage dividends potentially deductible by the cooperative and taxable to members
- **Cooperative LLCs:** Default pass-through taxation; profits flow to members' individual returns
- **Pennsylvania State Tax:** Pennsylvania personal income tax applies at a flat 3.07% rate
- **Subchapter T:** Federal cooperative tax treatment may apply for patronage dividends

Consult a tax professional familiar with cooperative taxation for your specific situation.

### Q6: Can I convert my existing business to a worker cooperative?

Yes. Pennsylvania has strong support for business conversions through organizations like the [Pennsylvania Center for Employee Ownership](https://ownershippennsylvania.org/) and [Democracy at Work Institute](https://institute.coop/). Key steps include feasibility assessment, business valuation, structure selection, financing arrangement, and employee education. Conversions are particularly popular as succession planning for retiring business owners.
