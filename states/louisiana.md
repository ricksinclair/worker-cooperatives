> **Disclaimer:** This guide provides general information and is not legal or tax advice. Consult a qualified attorney and accountant familiar with Louisiana business law before forming your worker cooperative.

---

## 1. Quick Summary: What Makes Louisiana Unique

Louisiana stands apart from every other U.S. state due to its **civil law tradition**, derived from French and Spanish legal codes rather than English common law. This distinction means that standard national templates and generic legal advice often fall short in Louisiana, making state-specific compliance mandatory. While Louisiana's private law follows civil law principles, its business entity laws have been modernized to align with national practices, though unique terminology and concepts persist.

### Key Characteristics of Louisiana for Worker Cooperatives

- **Civil Law System:** Louisiana is the only U.S. state whose private legal system is based on civil law. This affects contract interpretation, property rights, and how courts approach disputes.
- **No Dedicated Worker Cooperative Statute:** Unlike states such as California or Colorado, Louisiana does not have a specific worker cooperative corporation statute. Worker cooperatives typically form as LLCs or use general cooperative provisions.
- **Cooperative Statutes for Specific Purposes:** Louisiana Revised Statutes Title 12 contains cooperative provisions primarily for electric cooperatives (RS 12:401-422) and cooperative housing corporations (RS 12:499.1-499.23), but no general-purpose worker cooperative statute.
- **LLC Flexibility:** The Limited Liability Company is the most common and practical vehicle for worker cooperatives in Louisiana, with the Operating Agreement serving as the foundation for cooperative governance.
- **Parish-Level Licensing:** Business licensing occurs at the parish (county) level, requiring attention to local occupational license requirements.
- **Strong Cooperative History:** Louisiana has a rich tradition of agricultural, fishing, and community cooperatives, particularly in rural communities and among African American landowners.

### Common Entity Choices for Worker Cooperatives in Louisiana

| Entity Type | Best For | Key Consideration |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| **LLC (structured as cooperative)** | Most worker cooperatives | Flexibility; Operating Agreement establishes cooperative principles |
| **Corporation (general)** | Larger cooperatives; Subchapter T tax treatment | More formality; board required |
| **Nonprofit Corporation** | Service-oriented cooperatives with community benefit mission | Limited profit distribution |

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives in Louisiana

### Option A: Limited Liability Company (LLC) Structured as a Cooperative (Recommended)

**Governing Law:** [Louisiana Revised Statutes Title 12, Chapter 22 (Limited Liability Company Law)](https://legis.la.gov/legis/Laws_Toc.aspx?folder=86&title=12)

The LLC is typically the most practical and flexible structure for worker cooperatives in Louisiana. While Louisiana does not have a dedicated worker cooperative statute, an LLC can be structured to operate cooperatively through a carefully drafted Operating Agreement.

#### Key Features

**Operating Agreement as Foundation:**
Under Louisiana law, an Operating Agreement is defined as "any agreement, written or oral, of the members as to the affairs of a limited liability company and the conduct of its business." For worker cooperatives, this agreement must be meticulously drafted to:
- Establish one member, one vote democratic governance
- Define worker-member eligibility and admission procedures
- Create patronage-based allocation of profits and losses
- Include transfer restrictions to maintain worker ownership
- Protect cooperative principles from future amendment

**Registered Agent Requirement:**
Louisiana requires all LLCs to maintain a registered agent with a physical address in the state. The agent must be a Louisiana resident over 18 years old, or a business entity authorized to do business in Louisiana. P.O. boxes are not permitted.

**Formation Requirements:**
- File Articles of Organization with the Secretary of State
- File Initial Report along with Articles
- Filing fee: $100 (includes both documents)
- Annual report required on anniversary date; $30 fee

#### Advantages

- Greatest flexibility in governance structure
- Operating Agreement can be customized for cooperative principles
- No mandatory board of directors
- Easier informal decision-making for small groups
- Pass-through taxation available (or can elect corporate taxation)
- Managing members may have certain employment law considerations

#### Disadvantages

- Cooperative principles not embedded in statute; rely entirely on Operating Agreement
- Risk that future members could amend Operating Agreement to remove cooperative provisions
- May not be recognized as a cooperative by some lenders or grant programs
- Using "Cooperative" in business name requires approval from Office of Financial Institutions
- Cannot use Subchapter T tax treatment unless electing corporate taxation

---

### Option B: Louisiana Business Corporation

**Governing Law:** [Louisiana Revised Statutes Title 12, Chapter 1 (Business Corporation Law)](https://legis.la.gov/legis/Laws_Toc.aspx?folder=86&title=12)

A worker cooperative can also form as a standard business corporation and adopt cooperative governance principles through its bylaws. This approach may be preferred for larger cooperatives or those seeking Subchapter T cooperative tax treatment.

#### Key Features

**Corporate Governance:**
- Requires board of directors
- Shareholders elect directors; directors manage corporation
- Bylaws establish voting rules and governance procedures
- Can structure as one share per worker with equal voting rights

**Subchapter T Eligibility:**
Corporations operating on a cooperative basis can use Subchapter T (IRC Sections 1381-1388) for federal tax purposes, allowing deduction of patronage dividends paid to members.

#### Advantages

- Clear eligibility for Subchapter T cooperative tax treatment
- Well-established body of corporate law
- May be more recognizable to traditional lenders and partners
- Formal governance structure may benefit larger organizations

#### Disadvantages

- More formalities (board meetings, minutes, formal resolutions)
- Less flexibility than LLC
- Subject to Louisiana corporate income tax (3.5%-7.5% graduated rates)
- Subject to Louisiana franchise tax ($2.75 per $1,000 of capital over $300,000)
- Requires board of directors even for small groups

---

### Louisiana Cooperative Statutes: What Exists

While Louisiana lacks a general worker cooperative statute, Title 12 does contain cooperative provisions worth understanding:

#### Electric Cooperatives (RS 12:401-422)

These provisions authorize "cooperative, nonprofit membership corporations" for supplying electrical energy. Key features include:
- Nonprofit structure operating on cooperative basis
- One member, one vote (RS 12:408)
- Refunds to members based on patronage (RS 12:420)
- Non-liability of members for debts of cooperative (RS 12:422)

While designed for electric utilities, these statutes demonstrate Louisiana's recognition of cooperative principles.

#### Cooperative Housing Corporations (RS 12:499.1-499.23)

Louisiana's Cooperative Housing Corporation Law provides a framework for housing cooperatives:
- Three or more Louisiana residents can organize
- Dividend limitations (no more than 6% noncumulative)
- Stock transfer restrictions permitted
- Tax exemptions for capital stock (RS 12:499.12)

**Note:** Neither of these existing cooperative statutes is designed for worker-owned businesses, which is why LLCs and general corporations are the practical choices for worker cooperatives in Louisiana.

---

### Using "Cooperative" in Your Business Name

**Important:** Under Louisiana law, words such as "Bank," "Cooperative," "Guarantee," "Loan," "Mutual," "Savings," and "Trust" require approval from the [Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions](https://ofi.louisiana.gov/) when used in a business name. If you wish to use "Cooperative" or "Co-op" in your entity's legal name, you must obtain this approval before filing formation documents.

## 4. Governance and Documents You Should Prepare

### Essential Governing Documents

#### For LLCs Structured as Cooperatives

**1. Articles of Organization**
- Filed with Secretary of State
- Basic formation document
- Establishes LLC existence

**2. Operating Agreement (Critical Document)**

The Operating Agreement is the foundation of cooperative structure for a Louisiana LLC. Because Louisiana's civil law system requires precise documentation, this agreement must be meticulously drafted.

**Key Provisions for Worker Cooperative Operating Agreement:**

| Topic | Considerations |
|-------|----------------|
| **Membership Classes** | Worker-member class with voting rights; possible community investor class with limited rights; eligibility requirements |
| **Democratic Governance** | One member, one vote principle (explicitly stated); amendment procedures requiring supermajority to protect cooperative provisions |
| **Patronage Allocation** | How profits and losses are allocated; patronage basis (hours worked, wages earned, or equal); qualified vs. non-qualified allocations |
| **Capital Accounts** | Individual capital accounts for each member; collective reserve accounts; minimum capital contributions; redemption upon departure |
| **Management Structure** | Member-managed vs. manager-managed; role of any board or steering committee; officer positions and authorities |
| **Voting and Meetings** | Quorum requirements; supermajority requirements for major decisions; meeting notice requirements; electronic meetings |
| **Admission Process** | Candidacy/probationary period (typically 6-12 months); approval process for new members |
| **Termination** | Voluntary withdrawal procedures; involuntary termination grounds; appeal procedures; capital account treatment |
| **Transfer Restrictions** | Prohibit or restrict transfer of membership interests; ensure interests cannot be sold to non-workers |
| **Dissolution** | Distribution of assets; priority of claims; treatment of indivisible reserves |
| **Amendment Protection** | Supermajority or unanimous consent for changes to cooperative provisions ("cooperative lock") |

**Louisiana-Specific Considerations:**
- Under Louisiana's civil law tradition, Operating Agreements must be drafted with precision
- Generic templates are often insufficient; state-specific customization is essential
- Consider having the agreement reviewed by an attorney familiar with Louisiana business law

**Resources for Templates:**
- [Democracy at Work Institute Bylaw Templates](https://institute.coop/bylaw-and-operating-agreement-templates)
- [Sustainable Economies Law Center Templates](https://www.theselc.org/templates)
- [ICA Model Bylaws for Worker Cooperatives](https://institute.coop/sites/default/files/ica-model-bylaws.pdf)

---

#### For Corporations

**1. Articles of Incorporation**
- Filed with Secretary of State
- Establishes corporate existence and authorized shares

**2. Bylaws (Critical Document)**

Corporate bylaws should address:
- One share per worker-member with equal voting rights
- Board of directors composition and elections
- Officer positions and duties
- Member admission and termination procedures
- Patronage allocation policies
- Meeting requirements

---

### Additional Documents to Prepare

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Member Handbook** | Explains cooperative principles, policies, and expectations |
| **Membership Application** | Formal application process for prospective members |
| **Membership Agreement** | Contract between cooperative and each member |
| **Patronage Allocation Policy** | Details how patronage is calculated and distributed |
| **Conflict of Interest Policy** | Addresses potential conflicts for board/management |
| **Financial Policies** | Check signing authority, purchasing, expense reimbursement |
| **Personnel Policies** | Working conditions, leave, discipline procedures |

---

### Tax Treatment Considerations

**Subchapter T (IRC Sections 1381-1388):**

Cooperatives operating as corporations (or LLCs electing corporate taxation) can potentially use Subchapter T for favorable tax treatment:

- **Patronage Dividends:** Amounts paid to members based on patronage can be deducted by the cooperative
- **Qualified Allocations:** At least 20% paid in cash; members include full amount in current year income
- **Non-Qualified Allocations:** Cooperative pays tax; members include in income when redeemed

**Note:** LLCs taxed as partnerships cannot use Subchapter T. If Subchapter T treatment is important, consider forming as a corporation or having the LLC elect corporate taxation.

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

Business conversion to worker ownership is becoming an increasingly popular succession strategy, particularly as business owners approach retirement. In Louisiana, conversions can provide a path for preserving local businesses, jobs, and community wealth.

### How Conversions Typically Work in Louisiana

**Basic Process:**

1. **Exploration:** Selling owner(s) explore employee ownership options
2. **Feasibility Assessment:** Financial analysis, employee interest survey, structural evaluation
3. **Valuation:** Independent business valuation determines fair price
4. **Structure Selection:** Choose between worker cooperative, ESOP, or other structure
5. **Transaction Design:** Develop financing, payment terms, and transition timeline
6. **Legal Documentation:** Create cooperative formation documents and purchase agreement
7. **Employee Education:** Train workers on cooperative ownership and governance
8. **Closing:** Transfer ownership, often with seller financing over time
9. **Transition Period:** Sellers may remain as employees or consultants

### Worker Cooperative vs. ESOP: High-Level Comparison

| Factor | Worker Cooperative | ESOP |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| **Ownership** | Direct; one share per worker-member | Indirect; trust holds shares for employees |
| **Governance** | One member, one vote | Voting typically proportional to account balance |
| **Minimum Size** | Any size (even 2-3 workers) | Typically 15-20+ employees for cost-effectiveness |
| **Setup Cost** | Lower ($5,000-$50,000 typical) | Higher ($125,000+ minimum for setup) |
| **Annual Costs** | Lower | Higher (ERISA compliance, administration) |
| **Tax Benefits** | Patronage dividend deductions (Subchapter T) | Seller tax deferral (C-corp); deductible contributions |
| **Complexity** | Simpler structure | Complex ERISA compliance |
| **Culture** | Explicitly democratic; active participation | Varies; can be passive ownership |
| **Best For** | Small-medium businesses; values-aligned owners | Larger businesses; owners seeking significant tax benefits |

### Resources for Conversions

- **Project Equity:** [project-equity.org](https://project-equity.org/) - National organization providing free consultations and conversion services
- **Cooperation New Orleans:** [coopnola.org](https://www.coopnola.org/) - Local technical assistance
- **Southeast Center for Cooperative Development:** [co-opsnow.org](https://www.co-opsnow.org/) - Regional conversion support
- **Democracy at Work Institute:** [institute.coop](https://institute.coop/) - Publications on conversion process

### Considerations for Louisiana Conversions

- Work with professionals familiar with Louisiana's civil law system
- Ensure Operating Agreements are drafted to Louisiana-specific requirements
- Consider parish-level licensing transfer requirements
- Plan for employee education on cooperative principles and governance
- Allow adequate timeline (typically 12-24 months)

## 7. Common Pitfalls in Louisiana

### Legal and Structural Pitfalls

**1. Using Generic Operating Agreement Templates**
- **Pitfall:** Relying on generic LLC operating agreements not tailored to Louisiana
- **Reality:** Louisiana's civil law system requires meticulously drafted agreements that define ownership, management, member obligations, and dissolution terms in compliance with the state's Civil Code
- **Solution:** Work with an attorney familiar with Louisiana business law; customize documents for cooperative structure

**2. Failing to Protect Cooperative Provisions**
- **Pitfall:** Operating Agreement allows simple majority to amend cooperative principles
- **Reality:** Future members could vote to remove one-member-one-vote, patronage allocation, or other cooperative features
- **Solution:** Include supermajority or unanimous consent requirements for changes to fundamental cooperative provisions

**3. Name Approval Issues**
- **Pitfall:** Filing formation documents with "Cooperative" in name without approval
- **Reality:** Using "Cooperative," "Co-op," or similar terms requires approval from the Office of Financial Institutions
- **Solution:** Contact OFI before filing; consider alternative names if approval is delayed

**4. Employment Classification Confusion**
- **Pitfall:** Assuming all worker-members are independent contractors
- **Reality:** In most cases, workers performing services for a cooperative are employees for tax and employment law purposes
- **Solution:** Properly classify workers; comply with employment laws; maintain payroll, withholding, and workers' compensation insurance

### Compliance Pitfalls

**5. Overlooking Local Occupational Licenses**
- **Pitfall:** Registering with state but forgetting parish-level requirements
- **Reality:** Each parish in Louisiana has its own occupational licensing requirements
- **Solution:** Contact your parish clerk's office before commencing business; renew annually

**6. Missing Annual Report Deadlines**
- **Pitfall:** Forgetting annual report due on formation anniversary date
- **Reality:** Three consecutive years without filing results in administrative dissolution
- **Solution:** Set calendar reminders; file through GeauxBIZ; due date is your formation anniversary

**7. Registered Agent Lapses**
- **Pitfall:** Registered agent moves or becomes unavailable
- **Reality:** Louisiana requires continuous registered agent with physical Louisiana address
- **Solution:** Use professional registered agent service or ensure named individual maintains availability; update changes promptly

### Financial Pitfalls

**8. Co-mingling Personal and Business Funds**
- **Pitfall:** Not maintaining separate business accounts
- **Reality:** This is the quickest way for a court to "pierce the corporate veil," destroying personal liability protection
- **Solution:** Open dedicated business bank accounts immediately; maintain strict separation

**9. Subchapter T Misconception**
- **Pitfall:** Assuming LLC taxed as partnership qualifies for Subchapter T
- **Reality:** Subchapter T cooperative tax treatment only available for entities taxed as corporations
- **Solution:** If Subchapter T treatment is important, form as corporation or elect corporate taxation for LLC

**10. Undercapitalization**
- **Pitfall:** Starting without adequate reserves
- **Reality:** Cooperatives need working capital; distributing all profits weakens the business
- **Solution:** Require meaningful member capital contributions; maintain collective reserves; budget conservatively

### Governance Pitfalls

**11. Unclear Decision-Making Authority**
- **Pitfall:** Every decision goes to full member vote
- **Reality:** This creates inefficiency and decision fatigue
- **Solution:** Clearly delegate operational decisions to managers while reserving major decisions for member vote

**12. Inadequate Member Education**
- **Pitfall:** Admitting members who don't understand cooperative responsibilities
- **Reality:** Uninformed members may not participate effectively or may have unrealistic expectations
- **Solution:** Implement candidacy periods (6-12 months); provide cooperative education; use member handbook

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions (Louisiana-Specific)

### Q1: Does Louisiana have a specific worker cooperative statute?

**Answer:** **No.** Unlike states such as California, Colorado, or Wisconsin, Louisiana does not have a dedicated worker cooperative corporation statute. Louisiana's cooperative statutes in Title 12 of the Revised Statutes primarily address electric cooperatives and housing cooperatives. Worker cooperatives in Louisiana typically form as **LLCs** with carefully drafted Operating Agreements that establish cooperative governance principles, or as **general business corporations** with cooperative bylaws.

### Q2: What makes Louisiana's legal system different, and how does this affect forming a cooperative?

**Answer:** Louisiana is the only U.S. state with a **civil law system** based on French and Spanish legal traditions rather than English common law. This means courts interpret statutes and contracts differently, and generic national templates may not be sufficient. For worker cooperatives, this requires:
- Operating Agreements and bylaws drafted with greater precision
- Attention to Louisiana-specific terminology and concepts
- Working with attorneys familiar with Louisiana business law
- Avoiding assumptions based on how things work in other states

### Q3: Can I use "Cooperative" or "Co-op" in my business name?

**Answer:** **Yes, but with approval.** Louisiana law requires approval from the [Office of Financial Institutions](https://ofi.louisiana.gov/) to use words like "Cooperative," "Co-op," "Bank," "Trust," "Mutual," or "Savings" in a business name. Contact OFI before filing formation documents if you wish to include these terms. If approval is delayed or denied, you can still operate cooperatively without the word in your legal name.

### Q4: What are the ongoing compliance requirements for an LLC in Louisiana?

**Answer:** Key ongoing requirements include:
- **Annual Report:** Due on the anniversary of formation; $30 fee; file through GeauxBIZ
- **Registered Agent:** Must continuously maintain a registered agent with Louisiana physical address
- **Occupational License:** Renew annually with your parish/city
- **State Taxes:** File required returns with Louisiana Department of Revenue
- **Federal Taxes:** File required returns with IRS; issue K-1s to members (if partnership taxation) or W-2s (if employees)

Failure to file annual reports for three consecutive years results in administrative dissolution.

### Q5: How much does it cost to form an LLC in Louisiana?

**Answer:** The basic costs are:
- **Articles of Organization + Initial Report:** $100
- **Name Reservation (optional):** $25
- **Expedited Processing (optional):** $30 (24-hour) or $50 (while-you-wait)
- **Annual Report:** $30 per year
- **Occupational License:** Varies by parish (typically $25-$50 per year)

Additional costs may include registered agent services, legal fees for Operating Agreement drafting, and state tax registration fees.

### Q6: Are worker-members considered employees in Louisiana?

**Answer:** **Generally, yes.** Workers performing services for a cooperative are typically considered employees for employment law and tax purposes, regardless of their ownership status. This means the cooperative must:
- Comply with Louisiana employment laws
- Withhold and remit payroll taxes
- Maintain workers' compensation insurance
- Follow wage and hour requirements

There may be some flexibility for certain managing members, but this requires careful legal structuring. Consult with an employment attorney.

### Q7: What local support is available for starting a worker cooperative in Louisiana?

**Answer:** Louisiana has several resources:
- **Cooperation New Orleans:** [coopnola.org](https://www.coopnola.org/) - Technical assistance and financing for New Orleans area
- **Federation of Southern Cooperatives:** [federation.coop](https://www.federation.coop/) - Statewide cooperative development support

- **Southeast Center for Cooperative Development:** [co-opsnow.org](https://www.co-opsnow.org/) - Regional support including free Co-op Academy

### Q8: How do I register my cooperative for state taxes?

**Answer:** Use the **GeauxBIZ portal** ([geauxbiz.com](https://geauxbiz.com/)) which integrates the Secretary of State, Department of Revenue, and Workforce Commission. Through GeauxBIZ you can:
- File formation documents
- Register for state taxes
- Register for unemployment insurance
- Obtain sales tax permits

For existing businesses needing to add tax accounts, use the **Louisiana Taxpayer Access Point (LaTAP)** at [latap.revenue.louisiana.gov](https://latap.revenue.louisiana.gov/).
