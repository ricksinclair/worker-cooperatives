# How to Start a Worker Cooperative in Massachusetts

> **Disclaimer**: This guide provides general information about forming worker cooperatives in Massachusetts. It is not legal advice. Consult with an attorney, accountant, or cooperative development professional for advice specific to your situation. Laws and regulations change frequently.

---

## 1. Quick Summary: What Makes Massachusetts Unique

Massachusetts is one of the most supportive states in the country for worker cooperatives, offering:

- **Dedicated Worker Cooperative Statute**: [M.G.L. Chapter 157A - Employee Cooperative Corporations](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter157A) provides a specific legal framework designed for worker-owned businesses
- **Strong Support Ecosystem**: Boston and Western Massachusetts have robust networks of cooperative developers, lenders, and advocacy organizations
- **State-Level Recognition**: The [Massachusetts Center for Employee Ownership (MassCEO)](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-center-for-employee-ownership) was established by the Healey-Driscoll Administration as a statewide hub for employee ownership resources
- **Active Policy Advocacy**: The [Coalition for Worker Ownership and Power (COWOP)](https://cooperativema.org/) continues to advance legislation supporting worker cooperatives
- **Growing Sector**: According to the Massachusetts Employee Ownership Census, worker cooperatives in the Commonwealth nearly tripled between 2010 and 2022

**Common Entity Choices for Worker Cooperatives in Massachusetts:**
1. **Employee Cooperative Corporation** (Chapter 157A) - Purpose-built for worker ownership
2. **Limited Liability Company (LLC)** - Flexible structure with cooperative operating agreement
3. **Business Corporation** (Chapter 156D) electing cooperative governance

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives

### Option A: Employee Cooperative Corporation (M.G.L. Chapter 157A)

This is the recommended structure for most worker cooperatives in Massachusetts.

**Key Features:**
- Specifically designed for worker-owned businesses
- Members must be part-time or full-time employees
- One member, one vote democratic governance
- Can use "Cooperative" in the corporate name
- Permits distribution of surplus earnings based on labor contribution (patronage)
- Provides for internal capital accounts consistent with [Subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-A/chapter-1/subchapter-T)
- Non-voting stock may be issued to outside investors
- Prohibits mergers with non-cooperatives without member approval

**How It Works:**
Under [Section 3 of Chapter 157A](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter157A/Section3), any corporation organized under Chapter 156D may elect to be governed as an employee cooperative by stating so in its articles of organization or articles of amendment.

**Advantages:**
- Clear legal framework recognized by courts and regulators
- Built-in protections for democratic governance
- Aligned with federal cooperative tax treatment
- Signals cooperative identity to lenders and partners

**Considerations:**
- More formal corporate structure with required board of directors
- Annual report filing requirements
- May require legal assistance to navigate statutory requirements

### Option B: Limited Liability Company (LLC) with Cooperative Operating Agreement

An increasingly popular choice due to flexibility and lower formation costs in some contexts.

**Key Features:**
- Governed by [M.G.L. Chapter 156C - Limited Liability Company Act](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-law-about-limited-liability-companies-and-limited-liability-partnerships)
- Operating agreement can establish cooperative principles (one member, one vote, patronage-based distributions)
- More flexibility in governance design
- Pass-through taxation by default (can elect corporate taxation if preferred)
- Lower ongoing administrative complexity

**Operating Agreement Essentials for Worker Cooperative LLCs:**
- Statement that membership is tied to employment
- One member, one vote provisions
- Patronage-based allocation of profits/losses
- Membership admission and termination procedures
- Capital contribution requirements
- Governance structure (member-managed vs. manager-managed with elected managers)
- Buyout provisions when members leave

**Resources for LLC Operating Agreements:**
- [Democracy at Work Institute - Bylaw and Operating Agreement Templates](https://institute.coop/bylaw-and-operating-agreement-templates)
- [DAWI LLC with Permanent Capital Member Sample Operating Agreement](https://institute.coop/resources)

**Considerations:**
- No specific cooperative statutory protections
- Must carefully draft operating agreement to ensure cooperative principles
- Cannot use "Cooperative" or "Co-op" in name without Chapter 157A election
- Higher annual filing fees in Massachusetts ($500/year)

### Option C: Business Corporation (Chapter 156D) Without 157A Election

Some cooperatives form as standard business corporations but structure governance cooperatively.

**When This Might Apply:**
- When seeking certain types of outside investment
- When planning a gradual transition to full cooperative structure
- When specific business needs require corporate form flexibility

**Note:** If operating as a worker cooperative, electing Chapter 157A governance is generally recommended to access cooperative-specific provisions and protections.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Chapter 157A Corp | LLC | Standard Corp (156D) |
|---------|-------------------|-----|---------------------|
| Formation Fee | ~$275 | $500 | $275 |
| Annual Report Fee | $125 | $500 | $125 |
| "Cooperative" in Name | Yes | No (without 157A) | No |
| One Member/One Vote | Required | By agreement | By agreement |
| Patronage Dividends | Built-in | By agreement | By agreement |
| Pass-through Taxation | No (C-corp default) | Yes (default) | No |
| Outside Investment | Non-voting shares | Flexible | Flexible |
| Governance Flexibility | Moderate | High | High |

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

Converting an existing business to worker ownership is an increasingly popular succession strategy in Massachusetts.

### Why Convert to Worker Ownership?

- **Succession Planning:** Owners approaching retirement can sell to employees
- **Job Preservation:** Keeps businesses locally owned and jobs in the community
- **Wealth Building:** Creates ownership opportunities for workers
- **Business Continuity:** Maintains institutional knowledge and customer relationships
- **Tax Benefits:** Potential capital gains advantages for selling owners (proposed legislation would exempt first $1 million)

### Conversion Readiness Indicators

A business may be ready for worker cooperative conversion if it has:

- [ ] Minimal existing debt
- [ ] Strong financial health over past 3-5 years
- [ ] Positive future business forecast
- [ ] Stable operations and management systems
- [ ] Workers interested in ownership and governance participation
- [ ] Selling owner(s) willing to support transition period
- [ ] Time for proper planning (typically 2-5 years ideal)

### Steps in a Typical Conversion

1. **Exploration**
   - Initial conversations with cooperative developers
   - Education for owners and workers about cooperative model
   - Preliminary feasibility assessment

2. **Feasibility Analysis**
   - Detailed financial analysis
   - Business valuation
   - Assessment of workforce readiness
   - Governance structure planning

3. **Planning**
   - Develop conversion timeline
   - Structure the transaction
   - Draft governing documents
   - Create worker education program
   - Arrange financing

4. **Transaction**
   - Execute sale/transfer of ownership
   - File necessary legal documents
   - Establish cooperative governance
   - Transfer management responsibilities

5. **Implementation**

### Proposed Legislation: "Opportunity to Own"

Massachusetts is considering legislation that would:
- Require business owners to offer 30-day right of first refusal to employees when selling 51%+ of the company
- Give employees 180 days to make a competing offer
- Exempt selling owners from capital gains tax on first $1 million of sale to employees
- Support the state's response to the "Silver Tsunami" of retiring business owners

## 7. Common Pitfalls in Massachusetts

### Legal and Structural Pitfalls

1. **Choosing the Wrong Entity Type**
   - **Pitfall:** Forming as a standard corporation or LLC without proper cooperative provisions
   - **Solution:** Consult with cooperative developers and attorneys to select appropriate structure; strongly consider Chapter 157A election

2. **Incomplete Governing Documents**
   - **Pitfall:** Bylaws or operating agreements that don't address key cooperative principles
   - **Solution:** Use established templates as starting points; ensure documents address membership, voting, patronage, capital accounts, and separation

3. **Statutory Complexity**
   - **Pitfall:** Confusion between Chapters 156B, 156D, 157, and 157A
   - **Solution:** Work with an attorney familiar with cooperative law; contact Secretary of Commonwealth's Corporations Division with questions

4. **Insufficient Share Authorization**
   - **Pitfall:** Not authorizing enough shares in initial Articles, requiring expensive amendments later
   - **Solution:** Authorize sufficient shares for anticipated future membership growth

5. **Stock Ownership Limits**
   - **Pitfall:** Violating Chapter 157's limits on individual shareholding (no more than $1,000 par value or 1/10 of total shares)
   - **Solution:** Understand and comply with statutory requirements; structure capital accounts appropriately

### Governance Pitfalls

6. **Inadequate Member Education**
   - **Pitfall:** Members who don't understand cooperative principles or their governance responsibilities
   - **Solution:** Implement robust candidacy period with cooperative education; ongoing governance training

7. **Underdeveloped Decision-Making Processes**
   - **Pitfall:** Unclear how decisions are made, leading to conflict or paralysis
   - **Solution:** Clearly document decision-making authority in bylaws; distinguish between member votes, board decisions, and management authority

8. **Neglecting Board Development**
   - **Pitfall:** Worker-members unfamiliar with board responsibilities and fiduciary duties
   - **Solution:** Board training; clear policies; consider staggered terms for continuity

### Financial Pitfalls

9. **Undercapitalization**
   - **Pitfall:** Insufficient startup capital or failure to build reserves
   - **Solution:** Chapter 157 requires 10% annual reserve until reaching 30% of paid-up capital; develop realistic financial projections; explore financing options early

10. **Member Capital Contribution Structure**
    - **Pitfall:** Capital buy-in that's unaffordable or buyout obligations that strain finances
    - **Solution:** Allow payroll deduction for buy-in; create sustainable buyout policies; internal capital accounts per Chapter 157A Section 9

11. **Tax Compliance Issues**
    - **Pitfall:** Misunderstanding Subchapter T requirements for patronage dividends
    - **Solution:** Work with accountant familiar with cooperative taxation

### Operational Pitfalls

12. **Confusing Ownership and Management**
    - **Pitfall:** Assuming all owners must be involved in all decisions, or that hired managers undermine democracy
    - **Solution:** Clearly separate governance (member/board) from management; democratic workplaces can have managers accountable to worker-owners

13. **Workers' Compensation Classification**
    - **Pitfall:** Unclear treatment of worker-owners for insurance purposes
    - **Solution:** Consult with insurance professionals experienced with cooperatives

14. **Insufficient Attention to Annual Compliance**
    - **Pitfall:** Missing annual reports or tax filings
    - **Solution:** Calendar all deadlines; annual report due on formation anniversary; $500 LLC annual fee, $125 corporation annual fee

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: What's the difference between Chapter 157 and Chapter 157A?

**Chapter 157** governs general cooperative corporations (agricultural, dairy, mercantile cooperatives). It requires seven or more persons to organize and has specific provisions about stock ownership limits.

**Chapter 157A** specifically governs Employee Cooperative Corporations (worker cooperatives). It allows any corporation organized under Chapter 156D to elect cooperative governance by stating so in its articles. Key features include: members must be employees, one member/one vote, patronage-based distributions, internal capital accounts, and protection against mergers with non-cooperatives.

For worker cooperatives, Chapter 157A is generally the preferred statute.

- Employment law compliance

**Lower-cost options:**
- [Harvard Law Transactional Law Clinics](https://clinics.law.harvard.edu/tlc/) provides free legal assistance to qualifying community enterprises
