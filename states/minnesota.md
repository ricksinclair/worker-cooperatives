# How to Start a Worker Cooperative in Minnesota

Minnesota stands as one of the most cooperative-friendly states in the nation, with a rich history of cooperative enterprise dating back over a century. The state offers two dedicated cooperative statutes—[Chapter 308A (Minnesota Cooperative Law)](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/308A) and [Chapter 308B (Cooperative Associations Act)](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/308B)—providing entrepreneurs with flexible, purpose-built legal frameworks for forming worker-owned businesses. Combined with a robust support ecosystem centered in the Twin Cities, Minnesota offers exceptional resources for those looking to launch or convert to a worker cooperative.

## 1. Quick Summary: What Makes Minnesota Unique

**Minnesota's Cooperative Advantage:**

- **Dedicated cooperative statutes**: Minnesota is one of few states with two modern cooperative-specific statutes (308A and 308B), eliminating the need to adapt LLC or corporation structures
- **Strong cooperative tradition**: The state has a long history of agricultural, consumer, and housing cooperatives, creating an ecosystem that understands and supports cooperative enterprise
- **Robust support network**: Organizations like [Minnesota Center for Employee Ownership (MNCEO)](https://www.mnceo.org/), [Nexus Community Partners](https://nexuscp.org/), and [Cooperative Development Services](https://www.cdsus.coop/) provide free or low-cost technical assistance
- **Access to cooperative-specific financing**: [Shared Capital Cooperative](https://sharedcapital.coop/), headquartered in Minneapolis-St. Paul, offers financing specifically designed for cooperatives
- **Active conversion support**: Multiple organizations focus on helping retiring business owners transition to worker ownership, addressing the "silver tsunami" of baby boomer retirements
- **Free annual renewals**: Minnesota cooperatives in good standing pay no fee for annual renewals with the Secretary of State

**Common Entity Choices for Worker Cooperatives:**

| Structure | Best For | Key Features |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Chapter 308B Cooperative** | Most worker cooperatives | Greater flexibility, pass-through taxation option, modern statute |
| **Chapter 308A Cooperative** | Traditional cooperatives | Simpler structure, C-corporation taxation |
| **LLC with cooperative operating agreement** | Small groups wanting flexibility | Familiar structure, but less cooperative-specific |

Most worker cooperatives in Minnesota choose **Chapter 308B** due to its flexibility and modern provisions.

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives

### Chapter 308B: Cooperative Associations Act (Recommended)

The [Minnesota Cooperative Associations Act (Chapter 308B)](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/308B) was enacted in 2003 specifically to provide greater flexibility for cooperative enterprise. It is the preferred structure for most new worker cooperatives in Minnesota.

**Key Features:**

- **Flexibility**: Provides extensive flexibility in articles, bylaws, and governance rules to customize the cooperative to your needs
- **Pass-through taxation option**: May elect tax treatment under Subchapter K, providing pass-through treatment and avoiding double taxation on non-member business
- **Membership interest structure**: Allows both patron membership interests (worker-owners) and nonpatron membership interests (outside investors, if desired)
- **Modern governance provisions**: Includes provisions for electronic voting, alternative ballots, and flexible board structures

**Membership and Voting:**

- Patron members (worker-owners) are entitled to one vote per member on patron matters ([Section 308B.545](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/308B.545))
- Bylaws may provide additional voting rights based on patronage criteria
- Collective patron member vote cannot be reduced below 15% of total vote on cooperative matters
- Board must have at least five directors (three or more if 50 or fewer members)

**When to Choose 308B:**

- You want maximum flexibility in governance and capital structure
- You prefer pass-through taxation
- You may want to allow outside investor members in the future
- You're forming a new cooperative or converting an existing business

### Chapter 308A: Minnesota Cooperative Law

[Chapter 308A](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/308A) is the older cooperative statute (1989). It remains a viable option but offers less flexibility than 308B.

**Key Features:**

- **Simpler structure**: Shorter statute with fewer options, which can mean less complexity
- **C-corporation taxation**: Cooperatives under 308A are taxed as C-corporations under Subchapter T
- **Traditional cooperative model**: Follows more traditional cooperative principles without provisions for outside investor members

**When to Choose 308A:**

- You want a simpler, more traditional cooperative structure
- You don't anticipate needing outside investor capital
- Your cooperative model is straightforward with standard governance

**Important Note:** A cooperative organized under 308A may later convert to 308B by amending its organizational documents. A disclosure statement must be provided to members before the conversion.

### LLC with Cooperative Operating Agreement

While Minnesota's cooperative statutes are the preferred choice, some worker cooperatives form as LLCs under [Chapter 322C](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/322C) with a cooperative operating agreement.

**Considerations:**

- Requires careful drafting of the operating agreement to establish cooperative principles
- May be familiar to attorneys not experienced with cooperative law
- Does not carry the official "cooperative" designation
- Must ensure democratic control, subordination of capital, and equitable allocation principles are embedded in operating agreement

### Comparison: 308A vs. 308B

| Feature | Chapter 308A | Chapter 308B |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Enacted | 1989 | 2003 |
| Flexibility | Moderate | High |
| Outside investors | Not permitted | Permitted (nonpatron members) |
| Tax treatment | C-corp (Subchapter T) | Choice: Subchapter T or K |
| Complexity | Simpler | More detailed |
| Best for | Traditional co-ops | Modern worker co-ops |

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

Minnesota is a leader in business conversions to worker ownership, driven by the "silver tsunami" of retiring baby boomer business owners. Over 110,000 Minnesota and Wisconsin businesses are owned by people 55 or older, and over 80% lack succession plans.

### Why Consider Conversion?

**For Selling Owners:**
- Receive fair market value for the business
- Potential tax benefits
- Ensure business legacy continues
- Reward loyal employees
- Keep jobs and business in the community

**For Employees:**
- Opportunity for business ownership
- Wealth-building through equity
- Job security and local control
- Democratic workplace participation

### Conversion Readiness Factors

A business is well-suited for worker cooperative conversion if it has:

- **Financial health**: Minimal debt, strong performance over past 5 years, positive future forecast
- **Adequate size**: Ideally 10+ employees for strong governance and stability
- **Stable workforce**: Employees committed to the business
- **Viable business model**: Product/service demand expected to continue
- **Supportive owner**: Willing to engage in transition process
- **Time**: Conversions typically take 12-24 months

**Important**: Worker cooperative conversion is not a solution for struggling businesses. The business should be successful and stable at the time of conversion.

### Conversion Process Overview

**1. Initial Exploration**
- Owner contacts MNCEO or Nexus for free consultation
- Discuss goals, timeline, and basic feasibility
- Learn about conversion process and options

**2. Feasibility Assessment**
- Detailed financial analysis
- Business valuation
- Employee interest survey
- Governance planning

**3. Deal Structuring**
- Determine sale price and terms
- Structure financing (member equity, seller financing, external loans)
- Plan ownership transition timeline

**4. Legal Formation**
- Form cooperative entity
- Draft governing documents
- Execute purchase agreement
- Transfer assets/ownership

**5. Transition and Training**
- Employee education on cooperative ownership
- Board and governance training
- Management transition support
- Ongoing technical assistance

## 7. Common Pitfalls in Minnesota

### Legal and Structural Pitfalls

**1. Choosing the Wrong Statute**
- Not all cooperatives are treated equally for state and federal program eligibility
- A 308B cooperative with outside investor members may not qualify for certain cooperative programs
- Consider long-term implications before allowing nonpatron membership interests

**2. Inadequate Bylaws**
- Minnesota law requires bylaws to be adopted before distributions
- Failure to address required topics can create legal vulnerability
- Use experienced cooperative counsel to review documents

**3. Registered Agent Lapses**
- Cooperatives must maintain a registered office and agent continuously
- Using a personal address can lead to missed legal notices
- Consider professional registered agent services

**4. Annual Renewal Oversight**
- While free for cooperatives in good standing, failure to file can result in administrative dissolution
- Set calendar reminders for December 31 deadline
- Reinstatement requires fees and potential business disruption

### Governance Pitfalls

**5. Conflating Ownership and Management**
- Cooperative ownership does not mean everyone manages everything
- Establish clear roles, responsibilities, and decision-making authority
- Define what decisions require member vote vs. management discretion

**6. Consensus Paralysis**
- Over-reliance on consensus can slow critical decisions
- Balance democratic participation with operational efficiency
- Reserve consensus for major decisions; use majority voting for routine matters

**7. Lack of Accountability**
- Without clear accountability structures, some members may dominate or disengage
- Create systems for performance feedback and accountability
- Address conflicts promptly using established procedures

**8. Insufficient Board Training**
- Board members may not understand fiduciary duties
- Invest in board training and governance education
- Utilize resources from MNCEO, Nexus, and CDS

### Financial Pitfalls

**9. Undercapitalization**
- Many cooperatives fail due to insufficient startup capital
- Build adequate cash reserves before launching
- Plan for seasonal fluctuations and unexpected expenses

**10. Finding Financing**
- Traditional banks may not understand cooperative structures
- Contact Shared Capital Cooperative and cooperative-friendly lenders early
- Be prepared to explain cooperative model to potential lenders

**11. Unclear Patronage Allocation**
- Minnesota law requires clear allocation policies
- Patronage dividends have specific tax implications
- Work with accountants experienced in cooperative taxation

### Cultural Pitfalls

**12. Treating the Cooperative Structure as the Business**
- The cooperative model is governance structure, not value proposition
- Business viability must stand on its own merits
- Focus first on building a sustainable business

**13. Founder Dominance**
- Founders may resist sharing power as cooperative grows
- Plan for leadership transition from the beginning
- Build cooperative culture, not founder dependency

---

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q1: What is the difference between Chapter 308A and Chapter 308B cooperatives?

**Answer:** Both are Minnesota cooperative statutes, but they differ in flexibility and structure:

- **Chapter 308A** (1989) is the older, simpler statute. Cooperatives under 308A are taxed as C-corporations under Subchapter T and cannot have outside investor members.
- **Chapter 308B** (2003) offers greater flexibility. Cooperatives can choose pass-through taxation under Subchapter K, may include nonpatron (investor) members, and have more options for governance structures.

Most new worker cooperatives choose 308B for its flexibility. A 308A cooperative can convert to 308B by amending its organizational documents.

### Q2: How much does it cost to form a worker cooperative in Minnesota?

**Answer:** Initial formation costs include:

- **Filing fee**: $60 (mail) or $80 (online/in-person) for Articles of Organization
- **Registered agent**: Free if using a member's address; $49-300+/year for professional service
- **Legal assistance**: $1,000-5,000+ depending on complexity (optional but recommended)
- **EIN**: Free from IRS
- **Minnesota Tax ID**: Free

Ongoing costs:
- **Annual renewal**: Free if in good standing
- **Tax preparation**: Varies based on complexity
- **Accounting**: Varies

Total startup costs typically range from $100 (bare minimum, self-filed) to $5,000+ (with professional assistance).

### Q3: Do I need an attorney to form a worker cooperative in Minnesota?

**Answer:** Minnesota law does not require an attorney, and you can file formation documents yourself. However, working with an attorney experienced in cooperative law is strongly recommended because:

- Cooperatives have unique legal requirements
- Bylaws must address specific Minnesota statutory requirements
- Poorly drafted documents can create future problems
- An attorney can help customize governance to your needs

Free resources like [MNCEO](https://www.mnceo.org/) can provide referrals to cooperative-experienced attorneys. [City of Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/business-services/business-assistance/business-technical-assistance/cooperatives-help/co-op-consultants/) also maintains a list of cooperative consultants.

### Q4: How are worker cooperatives taxed in Minnesota?

**Answer:** Taxation depends on your chosen structure:

**Federal:**
- Most cooperatives are taxed under Subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code
- Cooperatives can deduct patronage-sourced earnings distributed to members
- Members pay tax on patronage dividends received
- 308B cooperatives may elect Subchapter K (pass-through) treatment

**Minnesota:**
- 308A cooperatives are treated as C-corporations
- 308B cooperatives may be treated as pass-through entities
- Patronage dividends follow general tax rules for character determination
- Register with [Minnesota Department of Revenue](https://www.revenue.state.mn.us/) for state tax obligations

Consult with an accountant experienced in cooperative taxation to understand your specific situation.

### Q5: Can we convert an existing business to a worker cooperative?

**Answer:** Yes, and Minnesota has robust support for business conversions. Key considerations:

- **Business health**: The business should be financially stable and viable
- **Employee interest**: Employees must want to become owners
- **Timeline**: Conversions typically take 12-24 months
- **Valuation**: Fair market value must be determined
- **Financing**: Often involves mix of member equity, seller financing, and external loans

Contact [MNCEO](https://www.mnceo.org/) or [Nexus Community Partners](https://nexuscp.org/) for free consultations on conversion feasibility.

### Q6: How many people do we need to start a worker cooperative?

**Answer:** Minnesota law does not specify a minimum number of members for a cooperative, but practical considerations suggest:

- **Minimum**: At least 3 members is typical for basic governance (chair, secretary, treasurer)
- **Board requirement**: 308B cooperatives need at least 5 directors (or 3 if 50 or fewer members)
- **Ideal for conversions**: 10+ employees provides stability and strong governance

You can start small and add members over time. Define membership qualifications and admission processes in your bylaws.

### Q7: What is patronage, and how do patronage dividends work?

**Answer:** In a worker cooperative:

- **Patronage** is the work performed by members (typically measured in hours worked or compensation earned)
- **Patronage dividends** are distributions of cooperative surplus allocated to members based on their patronage
- Unlike corporate dividends (based on capital invested), patronage dividends reward work contribution

Under Subchapter T:
- Cooperatives can deduct patronage dividends from gross income
- Members include patronage dividends in their taxable income
- This avoids "double taxation" at both cooperative and member levels

Your bylaws must clearly define how patronage is calculated and how surplus is allocated.

### Q8: Where can I get help starting a worker cooperative in Minnesota?

**Answer:** Minnesota offers extensive free and low-cost support:
