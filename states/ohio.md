## Quick Summary

### What Makes Ohio Unique for Worker Cooperatives

Ohio has established itself as a national leader in worker ownership and cooperative development. Several factors distinguish the Buckeye State:

**Progressive Cooperative Law**: [Ohio Revised Code Chapter 1729](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/chapter-1729), known as the Ohio Cooperative Law, provides one of the most comprehensive and flexible cooperative statutes in the United States. Major modifications in 1998 and 2004 transformed what was originally agricultural-focused legislation into a comprehensive corporation law suited to all types of cooperatives.

**The Cleveland Model**: Ohio is home to the [Evergreen Cooperatives](https://www.evgoh.com/about), a groundbreaking network of worker-owned cooperatives in Cleveland that has pioneered an approach to community wealth-building now replicated nationwide. Founded in 2008 through collaboration between the Cleveland Foundation, the City of Cleveland, The Democracy Collaborative, and local anchor institutions like Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic, Evergreen demonstrates how worker cooperatives can address economic inequality while creating sustainable green jobs.

**The Ohio Employee Ownership Center (OEOC)**: Established in 1987 at [Kent State University](https://www.kent.edu/kent/ohio-employee-ownership-center-oeoc), the OEOC is one of the nation's premier resources for employee ownership. The center has worked with over 700 businesses, helping more than 100 companies employing 20,000+ workers implement partial or complete employee ownership.

**Ohio Worker Ownership Network (OWN)**: This [statewide coalition](https://www.oeockent.org/the-ohio-worker-ownership-network) of 10 member organizations provides coordinated support for cooperative development across every region and major metropolitan area in Ohio.

**Strong Succession Planning Focus**: With 54% of Ohio businesses owned by baby boomers (representing 94,000 firms employing 2.6 million workers), Ohio has developed extensive resources to help business owners transition to employee ownership.

## Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Coops in Ohio

Ohio offers multiple pathways for forming worker cooperatives. The two primary structures are the Cooperative Corporation under Chapter 1729 and the Limited Liability Company (LLC) with cooperative provisions.

### Option 1: Cooperative Corporation (Ohio Revised Code Chapter 1729)

The [Ohio Cooperative Law](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/chapter-1729) provides a dedicated legal framework specifically designed for cooperative enterprises.

**Key Features**:

- **Formation**: Two or more incorporators may form an association under Chapter 1729. A single-member cooperative is possible only if that member is itself an association with at least two members ([ORC Section 1729.06](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-1729.06)).

- **Legal Status**: Ohio law treats cooperatives as nonprofit corporations because they are not organized to make profit for themselves or their members as shareholders, but rather for their members as patrons.

- **Governance**: Each member is entitled to one vote unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws specify alternate voting methods, such as voting based on patronage transactions or voting by delegates ([ORC Section 1729.17](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-1729.17)).

- **Stock Structure**: Cooperatives can create different classes of stock:
  - **Membership Stock**: Stock required for cooperative membership
  - **Patronage Stock**: Stock issued with respect to patronage transactions (essentially patronage dividends paid in stock)

- **Securities Exemption**: Membership stock and patronage stock of a cooperative are not considered securities under [Chapter 1707](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/chapter-1707) of the Ohio Revised Code ([ORC Section 1729.85](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-1729.55)), reducing regulatory burden.

- **Naming**: Cooperative names must include "cooperative," "coop," "co-operative," "co-op," "association," "assn.," "company," "co.," "incorporated," "inc.," "corporation," or "corp."

**Best For**: Worker cooperatives seeking formal cooperative recognition, those planning to issue membership and patronage stock, and businesses wanting clear statutory guidance for democratic governance.

### Option 2: Limited Liability Company (LLC) with Cooperative Operating Agreement

Under [Ohio's Revised Limited Liability Company Act (Chapter 1706)](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/chapter-1706), LLCs offer significant flexibility for structuring worker cooperatives.

**Key Features**:

- **Flexibility**: The LLC operating agreement can incorporate cooperative principles such as one-member-one-vote, patronage allocations, and democratic governance. Ohio's LLC Act serves largely as "default rules" that apply only when the operating agreement is silent.

- **Member Management**: Under Ohio's LLC Act, all LLCs are presumed to be member-managed unless the operating agreement states otherwise, aligning naturally with cooperative principles.

- **Decision-Making**: Default rules provide that ordinary course decisions require majority member approval, while extraordinary matters require unanimous consent.

- **Tax Flexibility**: LLCs can elect various tax treatments (partnership, S-corporation, or C-corporation), providing options for Subchapter T cooperative taxation.

**Considerations**:

- The operating agreement should be carefully structured to prevent future removal of cooperative provisions by worker-owners.
- LLC formation does not automatically confer "cooperative" status for purposes of using cooperative terminology in the business name.

**Best For**: Smaller worker cooperatives, startups seeking operational flexibility, and cooperatives wanting simplified formation while maintaining cooperative principles through contractual agreement.

### Tax Treatment Under Subchapter T

Regardless of legal structure, most worker cooperatives elect taxation under [Subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-A/chapter-1/subchapter-T) (Sections 1381-1388). This provides:

- **Single Taxation**: Net margins are taxed only once, either at the cooperative or member level, avoiding double taxation.
- **Patronage Dividend Deduction**: The cooperative can deduct patronage dividends from taxable income.
- **Qualified Dividends**: To qualify, at least 20% of patronage dividends must be paid in cash, and members must consent to include allocations in their taxable income (typically through bylaws).

While Ohio law treats cooperatives as nonprofit corporations, they are generally not tax-exempt. Consult with a tax professional experienced in cooperative taxation.

## Worker-Ownership Conversions

Ohio has become a national leader in business-to-cooperative conversions, driven by demographic realities and strong institutional support.

### The Ohio Opportunity

**The Challenge**: In Ohio, baby boomers own 54% of businesses, representing 94,000 firms employing 2.6 million workers with $118 billion in payroll. Though more than half plan to retire within a decade, 80% lack a formal succession plan. Most small businesses never find a buyer, putting communities at risk when they close.

**The Solution**: Worker cooperative conversion offers retiring owners a succession strategy that:
- Preserves their business legacy
- Maintains local jobs and community economic base
- Provides employees with ownership opportunities
- Often delivers competitive sale prices with favorable tax treatment

### Conversion Process Overview

**Phase 1: Exploration**
1. Contact OEOC for free initial consultation
2. Assess business readiness and owner commitment
3. Evaluate employee interest and capacity
4. Review financial position and sustainability

**Phase 2: Feasibility Analysis**
1. Financial due diligence and valuation
2. Assessment of cooperative governance potential
3. Identification of financing options
4. Development of preliminary conversion timeline

**Phase 3: Transaction Structuring**
1. Determine cooperative legal structure
2. Negotiate sale terms
3. Develop financing package
4. Create governance documents

**Phase 4: Implementation**
1. Form cooperative entity
2. Execute sale agreement
3. Transfer ownership
4. Establish governance and operations
5. Provide ongoing training and support

### Key Success Factors

Based on Ohio conversion experience, successful transitions require:

- **Owner Commitment**: Transitioning owner engaged throughout the process and committed to the cooperative model
- **Financial Health**: Business in strong, sustainable financial position
- **Participatory Culture**: Existing culture of transparency and employee involvement
- **Training and Support**: Programs for both employees and transitioning owners
- **Viable Financing**: Strategies creating feasible path for employee purchase
- **Professional Guidance**: Experienced legal, accounting, and cooperative development support

### Ohio Legal Advantages

Changes to the Ohio Cooperative Tax Code have removed significant barriers:

- **1042 Rollover Qualification**: Potential tax deferral for selling owners similar to ESOP transactions
- **Flexible Transition Timing**: Ability to structure gradual ownership transfers

### Case Study: Select Machine

Doug Beavers and Bill Sagaser, founders of Select Machine, Inc. (a specialty parts manufacturer in Brimfield, Ohio), sought to sell their company but received offers from competitors that would have closed the local operation. In 2005, they entered into a sales agreement with eight existing employees, forming a worker-owned cooperative that preserved jobs and the company's legacy.

## Common Pitfalls in Ohio

### Legal and Formation Issues

**1. Choosing the Wrong Legal Structure**
- **Pitfall**: Selecting an LLC without properly structuring the operating agreement for cooperative governance, or choosing a cooperative corporation when an LLC would better serve the group's needs.
- **Solution**: Consult with an attorney experienced in Ohio cooperative law before formation. Contact the [CFAES Cooperative Resources Directory](https://cooperatives.cfaes.ohio-state.edu/development-0/cooperative-legal-and-accounting-resources-directory-0) for referrals.

**2. Inadequate Bylaws or Operating Agreement**
- **Pitfall**: Using generic templates that fail to address cooperative-specific governance, patronage allocation, or member rights.
- **Solution**: Work with cooperative development specialists and legal counsel to customize governing documents. The OEOC provides guidance and templates.

**3. Improper Use of Cooperative Terminology**
- **Pitfall**: Using "cooperative," "coop," "co-operative," or "co-op" in business name without proper Chapter 1729 or 1702 organization.
- **Solution**: Only use cooperative terminology if properly organized under Ohio cooperative law. The Secretary of State will reject non-compliant name registrations.

**4. Neglecting Statutory Agent Requirements**
- **Pitfall**: Failing to maintain a qualified statutory agent or letting agent information become outdated.
- **Solution**: Ensure continuous maintenance of a qualified agent (Ohio resident or registered business entity). File updates promptly with Secretary of State.

### Tax and Financial Issues

**5. Misunderstanding Subchapter T Requirements**
- **Pitfall**: Failing to meet IRS requirements for qualified patronage dividends (20% cash minimum, member consent).
- **Solution**: Include Subchapter T consent provisions in bylaws or membership agreements. Work with a CPA experienced in cooperative taxation.

**6. Ignoring Commercial Activity Tax Obligations**
- **Pitfall**: Failing to register or file CAT returns when exceeding thresholds.
- **Solution**: Monitor gross receipts; register through Ohio Business Gateway if exceeding $6 million threshold. Consult with tax professional about CAT obligations.

**7. Underestimating Local Tax and License Requirements**
- **Pitfall**: Focusing only on state requirements while ignoring municipal business licenses, permits, and local income taxes.
- **Solution**: Contact your city or county clerk before opening. Many Ohio cities impose local income taxes and require specific business licenses.

### Governance and Operations Issues

**8. Insufficient Member Education**
- **Pitfall**: Expecting worker-members to effectively participate in governance without training on cooperative principles, financial literacy, and democratic decision-making.
- **Solution**: Implement ongoing member education. Utilize OEOC training programs and Ohio's Employee-Owned Network resources.

**9. Weak Capital Structure**
- **Pitfall**: Undercapitalizing the cooperative or failing to plan for member equity contributions and patronage retention.
- **Solution**: Develop realistic capital requirements. Structure member buy-in appropriately. Plan for retained patronage to build cooperative equity.

**10. Inadequate Conflict Resolution Mechanisms**
- **Pitfall**: Lacking clear procedures for addressing member disputes, performance issues, or governance conflicts.
- **Solution**: Include detailed conflict resolution procedures in bylaws. Consider mediation provisions. Establish clear performance expectations.

### Conversion-Specific Issues

**11. Unrealistic Valuation Expectations**
- **Pitfall**: Selling owners expecting market-rate sale prices that employees cannot afford, or employees underestimating fair value.
- **Solution**: Obtain professional business valuation. Work with OEOC to structure feasible financing that serves both parties.

**12. Rushing the Transition**
- **Pitfall**: Attempting to complete conversion too quickly without adequate employee preparation or owner involvement.
- **Solution**: Plan for 12-24 month transition periods. Ensure selling owner remains engaged. Invest in employee training before completion.

## FAQs for Ohio

### 1. What is the minimum number of people needed to form a worker cooperative in Ohio?

Under [Ohio Revised Code Section 1729.06](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-1729.06), at least two incorporators are required to form a cooperative association. A single-member cooperative is possible only if that single member is itself an association with at least two members. For practical governance, most worker cooperatives start with at least three to five founding worker-members.

### 2. How much does it cost to form a worker cooperative in Ohio?

Basic formation costs include:
- **Cooperative Corporation**: $125 filing fee (Form 603)
- **LLC**: $99 filing fee
- **Name Reservation** (optional): $39
- **EIN**: Free from IRS

Additional costs may include attorney fees for document preparation (varies widely), accounting setup, and local licensing fees. The OEOC provides free initial consultations and can help estimate total costs for your specific situation.

### 3. Do I need to hire an attorney to form a worker cooperative?

While not legally required, working with an attorney experienced in Ohio cooperative law is strongly recommended. Cooperative governance, tax treatment, and member relationships involve complex legal considerations that benefit from professional guidance. The [CFAES Center for Cooperatives](https://cooperatives.cfaes.ohio-state.edu/development-0/cooperative-legal-and-accounting-resources-directory-0) maintains a directory of attorneys with cooperative experience.

### 4. What is the Commercial Activity Tax and does my cooperative need to pay it?

The [Commercial Activity Tax (CAT)](https://tax.ohio.gov/business/ohio-business-taxes/commercial-activity-tax) is Ohio's gross receipts tax on business conducted in the state. As of 2025, businesses with taxable gross receipts of $6 million or less are not required to register for or pay the CAT. If your cooperative exceeds this threshold, you must register through the [Ohio Business Gateway](https://gateway.ohio.gov/) and file quarterly returns at a 0.26% rate on receipts over $6 million.

### 5. How are worker cooperative members taxed in Ohio?

Most worker cooperatives elect taxation under [Subchapter T](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-A/chapter-1/subchapter-T) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under this treatment:
- The cooperative can deduct qualified patronage dividends from taxable income
- Members report patronage allocations as individual income
- This avoids double taxation common to regular corporations

Members also pay Ohio state income tax on their wages and patronage income. Consult with a tax professional experienced in cooperative taxation for your specific situation.

### 6. Can an existing business convert to a worker cooperative in Ohio?

Yes, and Ohio is a national leader in business-to-cooperative conversions. The [Ohio Employee Ownership Center](https://www.oeockent.org/exit-planning) specializes in helping business owners transition to employee ownership. Ohio's cooperative laws have been modified to facilitate conversions, including potential 1042 rollover tax benefits for selling owners. Contact the OEOC for a free consultation about conversion feasibility.

### 7. What support resources are available for worker cooperatives in Ohio?

Ohio offers exceptional support resources:
- **[Ohio Employee Ownership Center](https://www.oeockent.org/)**: Free consultations, technical assistance, training programs
- **[Ohio Worker Ownership Network](https://www.oeockent.org/the-ohio-worker-ownership-network)**: Statewide coalition of 10 support organizations

- **[Ohio SBDC Network](https://clients.ohiosbdc.ohio.gov/)**: Free business advising statewide
- **[CFAES Center for Cooperatives](https://cooperatives.cfaes.ohio-state.edu/)**: Educational resources and professional directories

### 8. What is the difference between forming as a Cooperative Corporation versus an LLC?

**Cooperative Corporation (Chapter 1729)**:
- Dedicated cooperative statute with clear governance framework
- Automatic securities exemption for membership and patronage stock
- Can use "cooperative" in business name
- More formal structure with statutory requirements

**LLC with Cooperative Operating Agreement**:
- Greater flexibility in governance design
- Simpler formation process
- Cannot use "cooperative" terminology in name
- Cooperative provisions depend on operating agreement drafting
- May be easier to modify structure over time

The best choice depends on your cooperative's size, complexity, and long-term goals. Consult with the OEOC and legal counsel to determine the optimal structure.
