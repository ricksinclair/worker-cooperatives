# How to Start a Worker Cooperative in Nebraska

> **Last Updated:** 2024 | **Applicable Statutes:** Nebraska Revised Statutes Chapter 21 (Sections 21-1301 to 21-1306 - Cooperative Corporations; Sections 21-2901 to 21-29,127 - Limited Cooperative Associations; Nebraska Uniform Limited Liability Company Act)

---

## 1. Quick Summary: What Makes Nebraska Unique for Worker Cooperatives

Nebraska boasts one of the **strongest agricultural cooperative traditions** in the United States, providing a robust foundation and cultural acceptance for cooperative business models. The state offers multiple legal pathways for forming worker cooperatives, with dedicated support from the University of Nebraska system.

### Key Highlights for Nebraska Worker Cooperatives

- **Deep Agricultural Cooperative Roots:** Nebraska's agricultural cooperatives generate nearly $9 billion in economic activity annually, creating a state culture that understands and supports the cooperative model
- **Multiple Legal Structure Options:** Worker cooperatives can organize under the Nebraska Limited Cooperative Association Act (Sections 21-2901 to 21-29,127), traditional Cooperative Corporation statutes (Sections 21-1301 to 21-1306), or as an LLC structured with cooperative principles
- **Dedicated Cooperative Development Center:** The [Nebraska Cooperative Development Center (NCDC)](https://ncdc.unl.edu/) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln provides technical assistance specifically for worker cooperative formation
- **LLC Flexibility Available:** Nebraska's Uniform Limited Liability Company Act allows maximum flexibility in structuring a worker cooperative
- **Low Formation Costs:** Online filing fees start at just $100 for LLCs
- **Growing Worker Cooperative Sector:** Recent formations like Salt Slope (worker-owned farm, 2023) and Republican River Valley Home Care Cooperative (2025) demonstrate active growth in worker ownership

### Common Entity Choices

| Structure | Best For | Key Consideration |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| LLC (Chapter 21) | Most worker coops | Maximum flexibility; easy formation |
| Limited Cooperative Association | Coops seeking outside investment | Allows patron and non-patron members |
| Cooperative Corporation (21-1301) | Traditional cooperatives | Requires minimum 10 persons or one cooperative company |

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives in Nebraska

### Option A: LLC Structured as a Worker Cooperative (Most Common)

**Governing Law:** [Nebraska Revised Statutes Chapter 21 - Nebraska Uniform Limited Liability Company Act](https://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/browse-chapters.php?chapter=21)

The LLC is the most **flexible and commonly recommended** structure for worker cooperatives in Nebraska. While not a cooperative-specific statute, the LLC framework allows cooperatives to structure their operating agreement to incorporate democratic governance and patronage-based distribution.

**Advantages:**
- Maximum flexibility in governance and capital structure
- Pass-through taxation (single level of taxation)
- Limited liability protection for members
- Lower formation and ongoing compliance costs
- Ability to customize member rights, voting, and profit distribution
- Fewer regulatory requirements than traditional cooperative statutes

**Key Requirements for a Worker Cooperative LLC:**
- Operating agreement establishing "one person, one vote" principle
- Profits distributed based on patronage (labor contributed)
- Democratic decision-making structure
- Member eligibility tied to worker status

**Filing Requirements:**
- File Certificate of Organization with [Nebraska Secretary of State](https://sos.nebraska.gov/business-services/corporate-and-business)
- Filing fee: $100 (online) or $110 (in-office)
- Biennial report required

**Important Note on "Cooperative" in Name:**
Nebraska law restricts the use of "Cooperative" or any abbreviation thereof in business names. If you want to use this term, you may need to organize under a cooperative-specific statute or obtain approval from the Secretary of State.

### Option B: Limited Cooperative Association (Nebraska Limited Cooperative Association Act)

**Governing Law:** [Nebraska Revised Statutes Sections 21-2901 to 21-29,127](https://law.justia.com/codes/nebraska/chapter-21/statute-21-2904/)

Nebraska's Limited Cooperative Association Act provides a modern, flexible framework that combines cooperative principles with the ability to attract outside investment.

**Key Provisions:**
- May be organized for any lawful purpose, whether or not for profit
- Allows both patron and non-patron membership interests
- Patron members (worker-owners) maintain control
- Perpetual duration unless otherwise specified
- Partnership-style tax treatment available

**Required Information in Articles of Organization:**
- Name of the limited cooperative association
- Purposes for which formed
- Street and mailing addresses of initial registered office
- Name, street, and mailing addresses of registered agent
- Name and addresses of each organizer
- Term of existence (if other than perpetual)
- Number and terms of directors or method for determining them

**Filing Requirements:**
- File Articles of Organization with Secretary of State
- Filing fee: $100 (online) or $110 (in-office)
- Amendment fee: $25 (online) or $30 (in-office)

**Best For:** Worker cooperatives seeking outside investment while maintaining worker control; larger or more complex cooperative structures.

### Option C: Traditional Cooperative Corporation (Sections 21-1301 to 21-1306)

**Governing Law:** [Nebraska Revised Statutes Sections 21-1301 to 21-1306](https://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=21-1301)

This traditional statute governs cooperative corporations and may be suitable for larger worker cooperatives or those converting from existing cooperative structures.

**Key Provisions (Section 21-1301):**
- Requires not less than ten persons, or one or more cooperative companies, to form
- Formed by adoption of articles of incorporation
- Subject to powers and duties required of other corporations except as specifically provided

**Articles of Incorporation Must Include (Section 21-1302):**
- The word "cooperative" in the corporate name
- Statement that it proposes to organize as a cooperative corporation
- Dividends on capital stock fixed but not exceeding 8% per annum
- Net earnings distributed on basis of patronage (proportion to labor performed or services rendered)
- Detailed statement of method for distributing earnings
- Registered office and street address
- Current registered agent name and street address
- Name and street address of each incorporator

**Considerations:**
- Higher minimum organizer requirement (10 persons or 1+ cooperative companies)
- More formal corporate structure
- Dividend limitation on capital (8% maximum)
- Mandatory patronage-based distribution

### Worker Cooperative-Friendly Provisions Worth Noting

1. **Democratic Control:** All Nebraska cooperative structures support the one member, one vote principle
2. **Patronage Distribution:** Worker cooperatives distribute earnings based on labor contribution
3. **Limited Return on Capital:** Traditional cooperative statutes limit dividends on capital, ensuring worker primacy
4. **Flexibility in LLC Structure:** Operating agreements can incorporate cooperative principles without statutory constraints

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

### Overview

Business succession planning is increasingly important in Nebraska, particularly in rural communities facing aging business owner demographics. Converting an existing business to worker ownership can preserve local jobs, maintain community services, and provide a meaningful exit for selling owners.

### Why Consider Worker Cooperative Conversion

**For Selling Owners:**
- Reward employees who helped build the business
- Create a legacy that continues the business's mission
- Potential tax benefits through proper structuring
- Flexible sale terms (seller financing common)
- Continued involvement during transition if desired

**For Employees:**
- Preserve jobs in the community
- Build wealth through ownership
- Gain control over working conditions
- Share in business success

**For Communities:**
- Retain local businesses and jobs
- Keep wealth circulating locally
- Maintain essential services (especially in rural areas)

### Conversion Process

**Phase 1: Assessment and Feasibility**
1. Evaluate business viability and suitability for cooperative conversion
2. Assess employee interest and readiness for ownership
3. Review financial statements and determine approximate business value
4. Identify potential challenges and opportunities

**Phase 2: Planning and Structure**
1. Engage advisors (attorney, accountant, cooperative developer)
2. Obtain independent business valuation
3. Determine legal structure (LLC or cooperative entity)
4. Structure the transaction (asset sale vs. entity conversion)
5. Develop financing plan (member buy-in, seller financing, external loans)

**Phase 3: Formation and Transition**
1. Form the new worker cooperative entity
2. Draft operating agreement/bylaws with cooperative principles
3. Execute purchase agreement
4. Transfer ownership to the cooperative
5. Implement governance structure
6. Train worker-owners on cooperative management

**Phase 4: Ongoing Development**
1. Continue cooperative education
2. Develop internal systems and policies
3. Build capital through member contributions and retained earnings
4. Transition seller out of operations (if applicable)

### Tax Considerations

**Section 1042 Rollover:**
Business owners selling to worker cooperatives (or ESOPs) may defer capital gains taxes if:
- At least 30% of the business is sold to the cooperative/ESOP
- Proceeds are reinvested in qualified replacement property within 12 months
- Proper elections and filings are made

**Consult a Tax Professional:** Tax treatment varies based on business structure, sale structure, and individual circumstances. Work with advisors experienced in cooperative conversions.

### ESOP vs. Worker Cooperative Comparison

| Factor | ESOP | Worker Cooperative |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| **Governance** | Voting may be tied to shares | Democratic: one person, one vote |
| **Regulation** | Heavy (IRS, DOL, ERISA) | Lighter regulatory burden |
| **Setup Cost** | High ($50,000-$150,000+) | Lower (typically $5,000-$25,000) |
| **Ongoing Admin** | Annual valuations, DOL filings | Less administrative burden |
| **Tax Benefits** | Significant (S-corp exemption; 1042 rollover) | Pass-through taxation; 1042 available |
| **Best For** | Larger businesses (20+ employees) | Smaller to mid-sized businesses |
| **Worker Control** | Less direct control | Maximum worker control |
| **Minimum Employees** | No legal minimum (practical: 15-20+) | Any size (even 2-3 workers) |

### Nebraska Conversion Examples

**Republican River Valley Home Care Cooperative (2025):**
- Worker-owned home care cooperative in Arapahoe area
- Formed with support from Nebraska Cooperative Development Center
- Incorporated April 2025 with four worker-owners
- Addresses need for care services in rural Nebraska

**Salt Slope (2023):**
- Worker-owned cooperative farm near Lincoln
- Three acres focused on increasing local food sovereignty
- Demonstrates worker cooperative model in agriculture

## 7. Common Pitfalls in Nebraska

### 1. Choosing the Wrong Legal Structure

**The Problem:** Organizing under the traditional cooperative corporation statute when an LLC would be more flexible, or forming a standard business entity without cooperative provisions.

**The Solution:** Most Nebraska worker cooperatives benefit from the LLC structure with a comprehensive operating agreement incorporating cooperative principles. The Limited Cooperative Association is appropriate for cooperatives seeking outside investment. Consult with NCDC or a cooperative attorney before deciding.

### 2. Inadequate Operating Agreement or Bylaws

**The Problem:** Using generic LLC templates that don't address cooperative governance, patronage distribution, or member rights and responsibilities.

**The Solution:** Develop a thorough operating agreement that covers:
- One person, one vote governance
- Patronage-based profit distribution
- Member eligibility and probationary periods
- Capital account management
- Dispute resolution procedures

Contact NCDC or use USFWC resources for guidance on cooperative-specific provisions.

### 3. Ignoring the "Cooperative" Name Restriction

**The Problem:** Attempting to use "Cooperative" or abbreviations in an LLC name without understanding Nebraska's restrictions on this term.

**The Solution:** If you want "Cooperative" in your name, consider:
- Organizing under a cooperative-specific statute (21-1301 or Limited Cooperative Association)
- Using alternative terms like "Worker-Owned," "Collective," or "Employee-Owned"
- Consulting with the Secretary of State about requirements

### 4. Insufficient Capitalization

**The Problem:** Underfunding the cooperative at startup, leading to cash flow problems and inability to meet obligations.

**The Solution:**
- Develop realistic financial projections with NBDC/SBDC assistance
- Set appropriate member buy-in amounts
- Establish retained patronage policies to build capital
- Consider a mix of member equity, retained earnings, and external financing
- Plan for working capital needs, not just startup costs

### 5. Registered Agent Issues

**The Problem:** Using a P.O. Box without a physical address, allowing the registered agent to lapse, or failing to update agent information when changes occur.

**The Solution:**
- Ensure registered agent has a physical Nebraska street address
- Verify agent is available during normal business hours
- Keep registered agent information current with Secretary of State
- Consider using a commercial registered agent service for reliability

### 6. Missing Biennial Reports

**The Problem:** Forgetting to file required biennial reports, leading to loss of good standing or administrative dissolution.

**The Solution:**
- Set calendar reminders for filing deadlines
- Use online filing for faster processing
- Keep contact information current so you receive notices
- Fees are $25 online / $30 in-office for most amendments and reports

### 7. Overlooking State Tax Registration

**The Problem:** Beginning operations without registering with the Nebraska Department of Revenue, leading to penalties and back taxes.

**The Solution:**
- Register before hiring employees or making taxable sales
- Complete [Nebraska Tax Application (Form 20)](https://revenue.nebraska.gov/sites/default/files/doc/tax-forms/f_20.pdf) or register online
- Understand your filing frequency (monthly, quarterly, or annually)
- Set up systems for collecting and remitting taxes

### 8. Inadequate Member Education

**The Problem:** Worker-owners don't understand cooperative principles, their rights and responsibilities, or how to participate in governance.

**The Solution:**
- Implement onboarding program covering cooperative basics
- Provide ongoing education about finances, governance, and industry
- Encourage participation in NCDC and USFWC educational programs
- Create a member handbook with clear policies and procedures
- Hold regular member meetings with meaningful agenda items

### 9. Ignoring Local Licensing Requirements

**The Problem:** Complying with state requirements but overlooking local zoning, occupational taxes, or industry-specific permits.

**The Solution:**
- Contact your city and county offices early in the formation process
- Use the [Nebraska OneStop Portal](https://www.nebraska.gov/business/business-licensing/)
- Verify zoning compliance for your business location
- Obtain required health, building, and fire permits before opening
- Research industry-specific licensing (food service, childcare, construction, etc.)

### 10. Securities Law Oversights

**The Problem:** Issuing member equity interests without considering whether they constitute securities under federal and state law.

**The Solution:**
- Consult with an attorney about securities law compliance
- Worker cooperative membership interests may qualify for exemptions
- Be especially careful if accepting investment from non-worker members
- Document all member solicitations and transactions properly

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q1: Do I need to use a cooperative-specific statute to form a worker cooperative in Nebraska?

**A:** No. Most worker cooperatives in Nebraska form as LLCs under the Nebraska Uniform Limited Liability Company Act and structure their operating agreement to incorporate cooperative principles. This approach offers maximum flexibility and lower administrative burden. However, if you want to use "Cooperative" in your business name, you may need to organize under a cooperative-specific statute (Sections 21-1301 or the Limited Cooperative Association Act). Consult with the Nebraska Cooperative Development Center for guidance on your specific situation.

### Q2: What is the minimum number of people needed to form a worker cooperative in Nebraska?

**A:** This depends on the structure chosen:
- **LLC:** Nebraska allows single-member LLCs, but a worker cooperative by definition should have multiple worker-owners
- **Limited Cooperative Association:** No statutory minimum specified
- **Cooperative Corporation (Section 21-1301):** Requires not less than 10 persons, or one or more cooperative companies

For practical purposes, worker cooperatives typically start with at least 3-5 founding members to ensure viable governance and operations.

### Q3: What does it cost to form a worker cooperative in Nebraska?

**A:** Formation costs are relatively modest:
- Certificate of Organization (LLC): $100 online / $110 in-office
- Articles of Organization (Limited Cooperative Association): $100 online / $110 in-office
- Name reservation: Contact Secretary of State
- EIN: Free
- State tax registration: Free
- Operating agreement drafting: Varies ($1,000-$5,000 with attorney, or lower with template adaptation)
- NCDC technical assistance: Low or no cost (grant-supported)

Ongoing costs include biennial reports ($25 online / $30 in-office) and registered agent service if used ($49-$150/year).

### Q4: How is a worker cooperative taxed in Nebraska?

**A:** Worker cooperatives structured as LLCs typically receive pass-through tax treatment, meaning the cooperative itself generally is not taxed; instead, income and deductions pass through to members' individual tax returns. Patronage allocations to members are generally deductible by the cooperative when paid or allocated. Nebraska follows federal tax treatment in most cases, with state income tax applying to individual members. Consult a tax professional familiar with cooperative taxation for your specific situation.

### Q5: Can I get free or low-cost help forming a worker cooperative in Nebraska?

**A:** Yes, several resources are available:
- **Nebraska Cooperative Development Center (NCDC):** Provides technical assistance, facilitation, and guidance for cooperative formation at low or no cost (partially funded by USDA grants)
- **Nebraska Business Development Center (NBDC/SBDC):** Free business consulting, business plan assistance, and financial planning
- **U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives Co-op Clinic:** Culturally-affirming technical assistance and peer advisors; free startup webinars

Contact NCDC at [ncdc.unl.edu](https://ncdc.unl.edu/) to get started.

### Q6: How do patronage distributions work in a Nebraska worker cooperative?

**A:** Patronage in a worker cooperative is typically based on labor contribution, such as:
- Hours worked during the fiscal year
- Percentage of total cooperative labor
- Production units or other labor measures

Net income (after expenses, taxes, and reserve allocations) is distributed to members based on this patronage calculation. The cooperative can distribute in cash, credits to internal capital accounts, or a combination. The specific patronage formula should be detailed in your operating agreement. Many cooperatives retain a portion of patronage allocations to build capital, paying out the retained amounts over time (revolving fund or capital rotation).

### Q7: What happens to a member's capital account when they leave a Nebraska worker cooperative?

**A:** This depends on your operating agreement provisions. Common approaches include:
- Redemption of capital account balance over 3-5 years (to protect cooperative cash flow)
- Payment upon reaching a certain age or years after departure
- Redemption tied to the cooperative's capital rotation cycle
- Payment subject to cooperative's financial ability

The operating agreement should clearly specify:
- Timeline for redemption
- Any conditions or discounts for early departure
- Priority of redemption relative to other obligations
- Valuation method (typically book value of capital account)

### Q8: Can a Nebraska worker cooperative have non-worker investors?

**A:** Yes, particularly under the **Limited Cooperative Association Act**, which allows both patron (worker) and non-patron (investor) membership interests. This enables worker cooperatives to access outside equity capital while maintaining democratic control by worker members. Key provisions:
- Patron members must retain at least 50% of voting power on general matters
- Net income allocated to patron members must be distributed based on patronage
- Non-patron interests may have different rights regarding returns and distributions

Be aware that issuing non-patron membership interests may trigger securities law compliance requirements. Consult with an attorney before accepting outside investment.
