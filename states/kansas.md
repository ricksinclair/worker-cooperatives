# How to Open a Worker Cooperative in Kansas

A practical guide for forming and operating a worker-owned cooperative business in the Sunflower State.

---

## 1. Quick Summary

**What makes Kansas unique for worker cooperatives:**

Kansas offers a straightforward regulatory environment for forming worker cooperatives, though it lacks a dedicated worker cooperative statute. The state has a longstanding tradition of agricultural cooperatives dating back to the late 1800s, with the [Kansas Cooperative Council](https://www.kansasco-op.coop/) serving as the voice for cooperatively structured businesses since 1944.

**Key considerations for Kansas worker coops:**

- Kansas has a **Cooperative Societies statute** (K.S.A. 17-1501 et seq.) that requires a minimum of 20 citizen members to incorporate, which may be impractical for smaller worker cooperatives
- Most worker cooperatives in Kansas form as **Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)** with a cooperative operating agreement, providing flexibility and liability protection
- Kansas requires LLCs to have an operating agreement, which aligns well with worker cooperative governance documentation needs
- The state has a strong network of Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) and agricultural cooperative infrastructure that can support worker cooperative development

**Common entity choices:**

1. **LLC structured as a cooperative** (most common for worker coops)
2. **Cooperative corporation** under K.S.A. 17-1501 (better suited for larger groups)
3. **Standard corporation** with cooperative bylaws (less common)

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Coops in Kansas

### Option A: Cooperative Corporation Statute (K.S.A. 17-1501 et seq.)

Kansas has a Cooperative Societies statute under [K.S.A. Chapter 17, Article 15](https://ksrevisor.gov/statutes/chapters/ch17/017_015_0001.html). However, this statute has limitations for worker cooperatives:

**Requirements:**
- Minimum of **20 Kansas citizens** must associate together
- Corporation name must begin with "the" and end with "association," "company," "corporation," "exchange," "society," or "union"
- Must use the word "cooperative" in the corporate name
- Distributes net profits by: (1) payment of a fixed dividend upon stock, then (2) remainder prorated to stockholders based on purchases from or sales to the cooperative

**Limitations for worker coops:**
- The 20-member minimum is impractical for most small worker cooperatives
- The statute is oriented toward consumer and producer cooperatives rather than worker-owned models
- Profit distribution tied to patronage based on purchases/sales rather than labor contribution

**Best suited for:** Larger worker cooperatives with 20+ worker-members, or hybrid models combining worker and consumer ownership.

### Option B: LLC Structured as a Worker Cooperative (Recommended)

The **Limited Liability Company** is typically the most practical structure for worker cooperatives in Kansas. Kansas LLC law provides significant flexibility to design cooperative governance through the operating agreement.

**Advantages:**
- No minimum member requirement
- Operating agreement can establish democratic governance (one member, one vote)
- Flexible profit distribution based on labor/patronage
- Pass-through taxation (or can elect corporate taxation)
- Limited liability protection for members
- Kansas law gives "maximum effect" to operating agreements under [K.S.A. 17-76,134](https://www.kslegislature.gov/li_2012/b2011_12/statute/017_000_0000_chapter/017_076_0000_article/017_076_0143_section/017_076_0143_k/)

**Filing requirements:**
- File Articles of Organization with Kansas Secretary of State
- Fee: **$160 online** or **$165 by mail**
- Requires a Kansas registered agent

**Worker-coop-friendly provisions to include in operating agreement:**
- Democratic control (one worker-member, one vote)
- Membership tied to employment
- Patronage-based profit allocation (based on hours worked or wages)
- Member capital account structure
- Membership buy-in and redemption terms
- Governance structure (board, officers, committees)

### Option C: Standard Corporation with Cooperative Bylaws

A Kansas corporation can be structured with cooperative principles through its bylaws and shareholder agreements.

**Filing requirements:**
- File Articles of Incorporation with Kansas Secretary of State
- Fee: **$85 online** or **$90 by mail** (for-profit corporation)

**Considerations:**
- More rigid structure than an LLC
- Can elect S-corporation tax status (but limited to one class of stock)
- Less flexibility for cooperative governance provisions
- May be preferable if seeking outside investment with different share classes

### Comparison Summary

| Feature | Cooperative Corp (K.S.A. 17-1501) | LLC | Standard Corporation |
|---------|-----------------------------------|-----|---------------------|
| Minimum members | 20 Kansas citizens | 1 | 1 |
| Formation fee | ~$90 | $160 online | $85 online |
| Governance flexibility | Moderate | High | Moderate |
| Tax options | Corporate | Pass-through or corporate | Corporate (S-corp option) |
| Best for worker coops | Large groups (20+) | Most worker coops | Investment scenarios |

## 4. Governance and Documents You Should Prepare

### Operating Agreement (for LLCs) / Bylaws (for Corporations)

This is the most critical document for establishing your cooperative's democratic structure. Kansas law gives significant weight to operating agreements.

**Key provisions for worker cooperatives:**

**1. Membership Classes and Eligibility**
- Define who qualifies for worker-membership (e.g., employees who have completed a probationary period)
- Consider whether to have non-worker members (investors, community members)
- Establish membership application and approval process

**2. Democratic Voting Structure**
- One member, one vote (regardless of capital contribution)
- Quorum requirements for meetings
- Voting thresholds for different decisions (simple majority vs. supermajority)
- Proxy voting rules

**3. Patronage and Profit Allocation**
- Define "patronage" for worker coops (typically hours worked or wages earned)
- Allocation formula for distributing net margins to members
- Retention of collective reserves
- Distribution timing (annual, quarterly, at departure)

**4. Capital Accounts**
- Member buy-in requirements and payment terms
- Internal capital accounts for allocated patronage
- Redemption policies upon departure
- Interest paid on capital (if any)

**5. Governance Structure**
- Board of directors composition and election
- Officer roles and responsibilities
- Committees (finance, membership, etc.)
- Meeting requirements (annual, regular, special)

**6. Membership Termination**
- Voluntary withdrawal process
- Involuntary termination grounds
- Capital account redemption timeline
- Non-compete or confidentiality provisions (if applicable)

### Template Resources

The following organizations provide sample bylaws and operating agreements for worker cooperatives:

- [Democracy at Work Institute - Bylaw and Operating Agreement Templates](https://institute.coop/bylaw-and-operating-agreement-templates)

**Important:** These templates should be customized for your cooperative and reviewed by an attorney familiar with Kansas business law and cooperative structures.

### Additional Documents to Prepare

- **Membership agreement:** Contract between the cooperative and each member
- **Member handbook:** Policies, procedures, and expectations
- **Employment policies:** Wages, benefits, leave, workplace conduct

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

Converting an existing business to worker ownership is an increasingly popular succession strategy. In Kansas, this typically involves either forming a worker cooperative or an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).

### Worker Cooperative Conversion Process

**General steps:**

1. **Assess readiness:** The business should have minimal debt, strong financial health, and a positive forecast. Businesses with stable cash flow and 5+ years of profitability are typically better candidates.

2. **Engage advisors:** Work with a cooperative developer, attorney, and accountant experienced in conversions.

3. **Determine valuation:** Obtain a fair market valuation of the business.

4. **Structure the transaction:** Common approaches include:
   - Direct purchase by the new cooperative entity
   - Seller financing with gradual buyout
   - Bank financing with seller note

5. **Form the cooperative:** Create the new LLC or corporation with cooperative governance documents.

6. **Execute the sale:** Transfer ownership to the cooperative entity.

7. **Transition workers to member-owners:** Implement training, governance structures, and ongoing member education.

### ESOP vs. Worker Cooperative

| Factor | Worker Cooperative | ESOP |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| Best for | Businesses with fewer than 100 employees | Businesses with 15+ employees |
| Setup cost | $10,000-$50,000 typical | $50,000-$100,000+ |
| Annual maintenance | $3,000-$5,000 | $15,000-$30,000+ |
| Governance | Democratic (one person, one vote) | Stock-based voting |
| Tax benefits | Patronage deductible to coop | S-corp ESOP pays no federal income tax |
| Seller tax benefits | Potential capital gains deferral | 1042 rollover for C-corps |

**Key considerations:**
- Worker cooperatives are typically more practical and affordable for small businesses under 100 employees
- ESOPs require annual stock appraisals and trustee administration
- Cooperatives offer more direct democratic control for workers
- Both models can provide capital gains deferral for selling owners in certain circumstances

## 7. Common Pitfalls in Kansas

### Formation Pitfalls

1. **Using the Cooperative Societies statute for small groups:** The 20-member minimum under K.S.A. 17-1501 makes this impractical for most worker cooperatives. An LLC is typically the better choice for groups under 20 members.

2. **Neglecting the operating agreement:** Kansas law gives significant weight to operating agreements. A generic template without cooperative provisions will not establish democratic governance or patronage-based distributions.

3. **Forgetting the registered agent requirement:** Failing to maintain a registered agent can lead to missed legal notices and potential administrative dissolution.

4. **Missing biennial reports:** Kansas administratively dissolves businesses that fail to file their biennial report within 90 days of the due date.

### Governance Pitfalls

5. **Unclear membership criteria:** Ambiguity about who qualifies for membership and when can create conflict. Define probationary periods and membership approval processes clearly.

6. **Insufficient capital reserves:** Worker cooperatives need retained earnings for stability. Establish policies for maintaining collective reserves before distributing patronage.

7. **Inadequate member education:** Democratic governance only works when members understand their roles and responsibilities. Budget time and resources for ongoing member education.

### Tax and Compliance Pitfalls

8. **Misunderstanding patronage taxation:** Patronage allocated to members may be taxable income to them even if not distributed in cash. Work with an accountant familiar with cooperative taxation.

9. **Failing to register for state taxes:** If you have employees or sell taxable goods/services, register with the Kansas Department of Revenue promptly.

10. **Overlooking local requirements:** Some Kansas cities require occupation taxes or specific permits. Research requirements in your specific location.

### Conversion Pitfalls

11. **Overvaluing the business:** An inflated valuation makes the transition unaffordable for workers and threatens the cooperative's long-term viability.

12. **Rushing the transition:** Successful conversions typically take 1-3 years. Allow adequate time for planning, training, and cultural transition.

## 8. FAQs for Kansas Worker Cooperatives

### Q1: Does Kansas have a specific worker cooperative statute?

**A:** No. Kansas does not have a dedicated worker cooperative statute. The Cooperative Societies Act (K.S.A. 17-1501 et seq.) exists but requires 20+ members and is oriented toward consumer/producer cooperatives. Most worker cooperatives in Kansas form as LLCs with a cooperative operating agreement, which provides flexibility and does not have a minimum member requirement.

### Q2: What is the minimum number of people needed to start a worker cooperative in Kansas?

**A:** If forming as an LLC, there is no minimum member requirement - you can start with just one member and add more later. If using the Cooperative Societies statute (K.S.A. 17-1501), you need at least 20 Kansas citizens. For practical purposes, most worker cooperatives function best with at least 3-5 worker-members to share governance responsibilities.

### Q3: How much does it cost to form a worker cooperative LLC in Kansas?

**A:** The basic costs include:
- Articles of Organization: $160 (online) or $165 (mail)
- Name reservation (optional): $30-$35
- EIN: Free
- Operating agreement drafting: $500-$5,000+ (depending on whether you use templates or hire an attorney)
- Biennial report (ongoing): $50-$55 every two years

### Q4: Can a worker cooperative in Kansas elect S-corporation tax status?

**A:** Yes, an LLC or corporation structured as a worker cooperative can elect S-corporation tax status, but this limits you to one class of stock/membership interest. This may conflict with cooperative structures that have multiple membership classes or varying capital account balances. Consult with a tax professional to determine if S-corp status is appropriate for your cooperative.

### Q5: How are profits distributed in a Kansas worker cooperative?

**A:** Profit distribution is determined by your operating agreement or bylaws. Worker cooperatives typically distribute net margins (profits after expenses and reserves) as "patronage" based on each member's labor contribution - usually measured by hours worked or wages earned during the fiscal year. This differs from investor-owned businesses where profits are distributed based on capital ownership.

### Q6: Do worker-members have to buy in to join the cooperative?

**A:** This depends on your operating agreement. Many worker cooperatives require a member equity buy-in, which can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Buy-ins can often be paid over time through payroll deductions. The buy-in helps ensure member commitment and provides capital for the cooperative.

### Q7: Is there a Kansas state agency that oversees cooperatives?

**A:** No. Kansas does not have a dedicated cooperative oversight agency. Worker cooperatives formed as LLCs or corporations file with and are regulated by the Kansas Secretary of State, Business Services Division. Tax matters are handled by the Kansas Department of Revenue and the IRS.

### Q8: Where can I find an attorney or accountant experienced with worker cooperatives in Kansas?

**A:** The [U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives](https://www.usworker.coop/) maintains referral listings of cooperative-friendly professionals. The [Kansas SBDC](https://www.kansassbdc.net/) may also provide referrals. Given the limited number of cooperative specialists in Kansas, you may need to work with professionals in neighboring states or nationally who consult remotely.
