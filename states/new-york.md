# How to Start a Worker Cooperative in New York

*A practical guide to forming, funding, and growing a worker-owned business in New York State*

---

## Quick Summary: What Makes New York Unique

New York is home to the **largest worker cooperative ecosystem in the United States**, with over 100 worker cooperatives operating across the state—the majority concentrated in New York City. This growth is largely attributable to the landmark **[NYC Worker Cooperative Business Development Initiative (WCBDI)](https://nyc-business.nyc.gov/nycbusiness/business-services/initiatives/worker-cooperative-business-development-initiative)**, which launched in 2014 as the largest municipal investment in worker cooperative development in U.S. history.

**Key advantages of forming a worker cooperative in New York:**

- **Dedicated legal framework**: New York has [Article 5-A of the Cooperative Corporations Law](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/CCO/A5-A), specifically designed for worker cooperative corporations
- **Robust support infrastructure**: A network of nonprofit developers, legal clinics, and loan funds dedicated to cooperative business
- **Municipal investment**: NYC's WCBDI has invested over $12 million to date in cooperative development
- **Owner2Owners program**: Free technical assistance (up to $10,000 value) for business owners considering employee ownership transitions
- **Strong trade association**: The [NYC Network of Worker Cooperatives](https://nycworker.coop/) provides advocacy, networking, and member services

New York City alone has seen the creation of over 133 worker cooperatives through WCBDI, producing 442+ new worker-owners since 2014.

## Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives in New York

New York offers two primary legal structures for worker cooperatives, each with distinct advantages:

### Option 1: Worker Cooperative Corporation (Article 5-A)

**Governed by**: [NY Cooperative Corporations Law, Article 5-A](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/CCO/A5-A) (Sections 80-94)

This is the **purpose-built legal structure** for worker cooperatives in New York. Under Article 5-A, a business corporation can elect to be governed as a worker cooperative.

**Key features:**
- Must include "cooperative," "corporation," "incorporated," or "limited" (or abbreviation) in the corporate name
- Issues **membership shares** (one share per member, one vote per member)
- Only members may own membership shares; no capital stock other than membership shares has voting power
- Upon completing a probationary period, all regular employees must be offered membership
- Allows for **internal capital accounts** and **collective reserve accounts**
- Governed by Business Corporation Law except where Article 5-A provides otherwise
- Requires at least one director (five directors for general cooperative corporations)

**Best for**: Groups wanting a clear cooperative identity and legal recognition, businesses that may seek cooperative-specific financing, or conversions where democratic governance is paramount.

**Filing**: Certificate of Incorporation filed with [NY Department of State](https://dos.ny.gov/form-corporation-or-business) ($125 fee)

### Option 2: Limited Liability Company (LLC) with Cooperative Operating Agreement

**Governed by**: [NY Limited Liability Company Law](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/LLC)

An LLC can be structured to operate as a worker cooperative through its **operating agreement**, even though it cannot use "cooperative" in its legal name.

**Key features:**
- Greater flexibility in governance and profit distribution structures
- No requirement to link voting power to capital investment
- Operating agreement can establish one-member-one-vote, patronage-based distributions, and democratic governance
- **Required**: Operating agreement must be adopted within 90 days of filing Articles of Organization
- **Publication requirement**: Must publish formation notice in two newspapers for six consecutive weeks (designated by County Clerk)

**Best for**: Groups wanting maximum structural flexibility, businesses in industries where "LLC" is standard, or situations where cooperative-specific legal identity is less critical.

**Filing**: Articles of Organization filed with [NY Department of State](https://dos.ny.gov/form-corporation-or-business) ($200 fee)

**Important note on LLC publication costs**: Publication fees vary significantly by county. NYC counties can cost over $1,000, while Albany County is under $200.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Article 5-A Corporation | Cooperative LLC |
|---------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Filing fee | $125 | $200 |
| Can use "Cooperative" in name | Yes (required) | No |
| Publication requirement | No | Yes (6 weeks, 2 newspapers) |
| Operating agreement required | No (bylaws) | Yes (within 90 days) |
| Membership share structure | Required by statute | Defined in operating agreement |
| Flexibility | Moderate | High |

## FAQs for New York Worker Cooperatives

### 1. How many people do I need to start a worker cooperative in New York?

For an **Article 5-A Worker Cooperative Corporation**, there is no minimum number of members required to incorporate, but you need at least one director. For a general cooperative corporation under the Cooperative Corporations Law, you need five or more incorporators. For an **LLC**, you can form with a single member. However, the cooperative model works best with multiple worker-owners who can share governance responsibilities and workload.

### 2. What's the difference between an Article 5-A corporation and a cooperative LLC?

**Article 5-A corporation**: Purpose-built legal structure for worker cooperatives under NY Cooperative Corporations Law. Must include "cooperative" (or similar) in name. Governed by statute requiring membership shares, one-member-one-vote, and specific governance structures. No publication requirement.

**Cooperative LLC**: Standard LLC structured as cooperative through operating agreement. Cannot use "cooperative" in legal name. More flexible but requires publication in two newspapers for six weeks (can be costly in NYC). Operating agreement must be adopted within 90 days.

### 3. How much does it cost to form a worker cooperative in New York?

**Minimum costs:**
- Article 5-A Corporation: $125 (filing fee)
- LLC: $200 (filing fee) + $200-$1,500+ (publication fees vary by county)

**Additional potential costs:**
- Name reservation: $20
- Registered agent service: $50-$300/year
- Legal assistance: varies (free through CUNY Law Clinic for qualifying organizations)
- Accounting/tax setup: varies

### 4. Do I need a lawyer to form a worker cooperative?

The [CUNY Law Community & Economic Development Clinic](https://www.law.cuny.edu/academics/clinical-programs/ced/) provides pro bono legal services for worker cooperatives in New York. Cooperative development organizations like ICA Group and Green Worker Cooperatives can also provide guidance and referrals.

### 5. What taxes does a New York worker cooperative pay?

Worker cooperatives generally pay:
- **Federal income tax**: Cooperatives may deduct patronage dividends distributed to members
- **NY State franchise tax**: Annual filing required
- **NYC taxes**: If operating in NYC, may owe NYC business taxes
- **Sales tax**: If selling taxable goods/services
- **Payroll taxes**: For employee wages

Patronage dividends have specific tax treatment—consult an accountant familiar with Subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code.

### 6. How do worker-owners get paid in a cooperative?

Worker-owners typically receive:
1. **Wages**: Regular compensation for work performed (subject to payroll taxes)
2. **Patronage dividends**: Share of profits based on patronage (usually hours worked or wages earned), distributed after fiscal year-end
3. **Internal capital account allocations**: Retained earnings credited to individual member accounts

The specific compensation structure is defined in bylaws (corporation) or operating agreement (LLC).

### 7. Can an existing business convert to a worker cooperative?

Yes, and New York actively supports business conversions through the **Owner2Owners** program. Business owners can receive up to $10,000 in free technical assistance to explore employee ownership. Contact the [Owner2Owners hotline](https://www.owner2owners.nyc) at (646) 363-6592. Organizations like ICA Group specialize in guiding businesses through conversion transactions.
