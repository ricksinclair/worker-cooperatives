# How to Open a Worker Cooperative in Hawaii

A comprehensive guide to forming and operating a worker-owned cooperative business in the State of Hawaii.

---

## 1. Quick Summary

**What makes Hawaii unique for worker cooperatives:**

Hawaii offers a distinctive environment for worker cooperatives, featuring **two dedicated cooperative statutes** - one for agricultural cooperatives (HRS Chapter 421) and one for consumer cooperatives (HRS Chapter 421C). The state has a strong cooperative tradition, particularly in agriculture with organizations like the Hawaii Ulu Cooperative. Additionally, Hawaii's legislature has explicitly recognized the importance of worker cooperatives in creating sustainable jobs and generating community wealth.

**Key distinguishing features:**

- **Two Cooperative Statutes:** HRS Chapter 421 (Agricultural Cooperative Associations) and HRS Chapter 421C (Consumer Cooperative Associations) provide statutory frameworks for cooperative corporations
- **Worker Cooperative Legislative Recognition:** Hawaii legislature has found that worker cooperatives serve important purposes including sustainable job creation, dignifying human work, and promoting community development
- **Low Filing Fees:** Nonprofit cooperative articles of incorporation cost only $25 (one of the lowest in the nation)
- **Strong Agricultural Cooperative Tradition:** Hawaii has thriving agricultural cooperatives including the Hawaii Ulu Cooperative with nearly 100 member-farmers
- **One Member, One Vote:** HRS 421C-14 explicitly establishes democratic voting principles
- **Pacific Island Network:** Access to Pacific Islands Small Business Development Center Network and regional cooperative support
- **General Excise Tax (GET):** Hawaii has no traditional sales tax but imposes GET on gross business income (typically 4% plus county surcharges)

**Common entity choices for worker coops in Hawaii:**

1. **Consumer Cooperative Corporation** (HRS Chapter 421C) - Most adaptable for worker cooperatives
2. **Agricultural Cooperative Corporation** (HRS Chapter 421) - Suitable for agricultural worker cooperatives
3. **Limited Liability Company (LLC)** with cooperative operating agreement - Offers flexibility and pass-through taxation
4. **Standard Corporation** with cooperative bylaws - Less common but viable for specific needs

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Coops in Hawaii

### Option A: Consumer Cooperative Corporation (HRS Chapter 421C)

**Statutory Authority:** [Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 421C - Consumer Cooperative Associations](https://law.justia.com/codes/hawaii/title-23/chapter-421c/)

Hawaii's Consumer Cooperative statute provides a comprehensive framework that can accommodate worker cooperative structures. While designed for consumer cooperatives, the broad provisions make it adaptable for worker ownership models.

**Formation Requirements:**
- File Articles of Incorporation for a Consumer Cooperative (Form CONS-1)
- Articles must comply with HRS Chapter 421C requirements
- Name must include appropriate cooperative designation

**Key Provisions:**

**One Member, One Vote (Section 421C-14):**
Each member of an association shall have one and only one vote, establishing democratic governance as a statutory requirement.

**Bylaws Contents (Section 421C-12):**
Bylaws must address qualifications for membership, meeting procedures, officer/director roles, and allocation of net savings.

**Net Savings Distribution (Section 421C-25):**
- Business operated at cost with net margins returned on patronage basis
- Allocation and distribution of net savings to members and qualified persons
- Reasonable reserves permitted as determined by board

**Membership (Section 421C-20):**
Membership requirements established in articles or bylaws; admission procedures defined by association.

**Limitations on Interest-Dividends (Section 421C-19):**
Maximum rate on share or membership capital is limited, with allocation to member patrons based on patronage.

**Advantages:**
- Purpose-built cooperative statutory framework
- Explicit one-member-one-vote provision
- Clear guidance on patronage and net savings distribution
- Very low filing fee ($25)
- Nonprofit cooperative status available

**Considerations:**
- Originally designed for consumer cooperatives; may require adaptation for worker cooperative specifics
- Corporate formalities required (annual meetings, minutes, etc.)

**Filing Fee:** $25 (nonprofit cooperative)

---

### Option B: Agricultural Cooperative Corporation (HRS Chapter 421)

**Statutory Authority:** [Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 421 - Agricultural Cooperative Associations](https://law.justia.com/codes/hawaii/title-23/chapter-421/)

For worker cooperatives engaged in agricultural production, processing, or marketing, the Agricultural Cooperative statute provides a strong foundation.

**Formation Requirements (Section 421-1 through 421-25):**
- Three or more persons may incorporate
- File Articles of Incorporation (Form AG-1)
- Name must contain "cooperative" designation
- Board of not less than three directors required

**Key Provisions:**

**Definitions (Section 421-1):**
"Association" means any corporation organized for the mutual benefit of its members as agricultural producers. Associations are deemed nonprofit corporations since their primary object is not to pay dividends on invested capital but to render service and provide means and facilities for producers.

**Powers (Section 421-9):**
Associations have capacity to act possessed by natural persons for purposes set forth in articles, including acquiring property, borrowing money, and dealing in agricultural products.

**Directors (Section 421-13):**
At least two-thirds of directors must be members of the association or officers/directors/members of a member association.

**Bylaws (Section 421-8):**
Bylaws must be adopted by majority of members voting; may provide for voting on basis of patronage.

**Dividends (Section 421-11):**
Dividends in excess of eight percent on actual cash value shall not be paid on common or preferred stock or membership capital; dividends may be cumulative.

**Advantages:**
- Well-established framework for agricultural operations
- Clear patronage-based distribution provisions
- Very low filing fee ($25)
- Suited for Hawaii's agricultural sector
- General corporation laws apply where not specifically addressed

**Considerations:**
- Limited to agricultural purposes and related activities
- May require specific agricultural connection for worker cooperative

**Filing Fee:** $25 (nonprofit cooperative)

---

### Option C: LLC with Cooperative Operating Agreement

**Statutory Authority:** [Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 428 - Uniform Limited Liability Company Act](https://cca.hawaii.gov/breg/registration/dllc/)

An LLC can be structured to operate as a worker cooperative through a carefully drafted operating agreement. This approach is increasingly common for worker cooperatives seeking flexibility.

**Key Operating Agreement Provisions for Cooperative LLCs:**

1. **One-Member-One-Vote:** Hawaii LLC law permits operating agreements to establish any voting structure. Explicitly establish democratic voting regardless of capital contribution.

2. **Patronage-Based Distributions:** The operating agreement can specify that profits are distributed based on labor contribution (patronage) rather than capital investment.

3. **Membership Classes:** Define worker-member class with specific rights, obligations, and pathways to membership.

4. **Buyback Provisions:** Include terms for redeeming member interests upon departure.

5. **Democratic Governance:** Establish board election procedures, member meeting requirements, and decision-making protocols.

**Advantages:**
- Pass-through taxation (avoids double taxation)
- Flexible governance structure
- Less formal requirements than corporations
- Well-suited for smaller worker cooperatives
- Affordable filing fee ($50)

**Considerations:**
- Cannot use "cooperative" in entity name without potential confusion
- Must carefully draft operating agreement to achieve cooperative principles
- No dedicated statutory guidance for cooperative-specific issues
- Requires knowledgeable attorney for proper structuring
- Default Chapter 428 rules may not align with cooperative principles

**Filing Fee:** $50 (plus $1 State Archives fee)

---

### Worker Coop-Friendly Provisions Worth Noting

1. **Legislative Recognition of Worker Cooperatives:** Hawaii's legislature has explicitly found that worker cooperatives serve important purposes including creating sustainable jobs, generating wealth for worker-members, dignifying human work, and promoting community development.

2. **Employment Status Clarification:** The election to be organized as a worker cooperative does not create a presumption that workers are employees of the cooperative for any reason.

3. **One Member, One Vote Protection:** HRS 421C-14 provides statutory protection for democratic voting in consumer cooperatives.

4. **Patronage Distribution Framework:** Both cooperative statutes provide clear frameworks for distributing net savings based on patronage.

5. **Community Investor Provisions:** For worker cooperatives with community investors, voting power is limited to approval rights only over major transactions (merger, sale of major assets, reorganization, dissolution).

6. **Low Barrier to Entry:** Hawaii's cooperative corporation filing fees ($25) are among the lowest in the nation.

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

### Converting an Existing Business to Worker Ownership

Business succession through worker ownership is an increasingly important option in Hawaii, where many business owners are approaching retirement. This approach can preserve jobs, maintain business legacy, and keep enterprises locally owned.

### Two Primary Paths: ESOP vs. Worker Cooperative

| Factor | Worker Cooperative | ESOP |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| **Best Fit** | Smaller businesses (<100 employees) | Larger businesses (typically 20+ employees) |
| **Setup Cost** | Lower ($10,000-$50,000 typical) | Higher ($50,000-$150,000+) |
| **Ongoing Cost** | Lower (no required annual valuations) | Higher (annual appraisals, trustee fees) |
| **Governance** | One-member-one-vote | Voting typically proportional to shares |
| **Tax Treatment** | Pass-through (if LLC or S-Corp) | C-Corp can be 100% tax-exempt |
| **Section 1042 Rollover** | Available for C-Corps | Available for C-Corps |
| **Regulation** | Minimal federal regulation | Heavy ERISA/DOL regulation |
| **Democratic Control** | Built into structure | Optional, requires specific plan design |

### Hawaii ESOP Landscape

Hawaii has a significant employee ownership presence with approximately 65 ESOP businesses. The Hawaii chapter of the ESOP Association has about 40 member companies. Notable Hawaii ESOP companies include:

- **Roberts Hawaii:** Became employee-owned in 2008 through ESOP implementation
- **The Solaray Corporation:** 100% employee-owned renewable energy company, implemented ESOP in 2014
- **Bowers + Kubota Consulting:** Became 100% ESOP in 2012
- **Allied Builders System**
- **Shioi Construction**
- **DTRIC Insurance**
- **Maui Divers**
- **HPM Building Supply**

### Key Differences Between ESOPs and Worker Cooperatives

**ESOP Structure:**
- Federally-regulated employee benefit plan
- Ownership interest through shares allocated from ESOP trust
- Employees never directly own shares
- No requirement for democratic structure
- Rarely can workers direct how shares get voted

**Worker Cooperative Structure:**
- Member-owned business entity
- Worker-owners have controlling interest
- One-member-one-vote governance
- Direct ownership and democratic control
- Equal share ownership regardless of tenure or pay

### Typical Worker Cooperative Conversion Process

1. **Feasibility Assessment**
   - Professional business valuation
   - Financial analysis and projections
   - Worker interest and readiness assessment
   - Legal structure analysis

2. **Transition Planning**
   - Timeline development (typically 1-3 years)
   - Financing structure design
   - Leadership succession planning
   - Communication strategy

3. **Legal Structure**
   - Entity conversion or new entity formation
   - Purchase agreement negotiation
   - Bylaws/operating agreement drafting
   - Tax planning

4. **Financing the Buyout**
   - Seller financing (most common - often 50-80% of purchase price)
   - Bank loans (SBA 7(a) particularly useful)
   - Worker capital contributions
   - Combination approaches

5. **Implementation**
   - Governance training for new worker-owners
   - Operational transition
   - Financial literacy education
   - Ongoing technical assistance

### Hawaii-Specific Considerations

- **Agricultural Sector Opportunity:** Hawaii's strong agricultural cooperative tradition creates natural pathways for worker cooperative development
- **Tourism Industry:** Many Hawaii businesses serve tourism; cooperative structure can help maintain local ownership
- **Island Economics:** Cooperative structure can help keep wealth circulating locally within island communities
- **Cultural Alignment:** Cooperative values align with Hawaii's traditions of community and collective responsibility

### Resources for Conversions

- [Democracy at Work Institute - Conversions](https://institute.coop/topics/conversion)
- [Project Equity](https://project-equity.org/) - National organization focused on business conversions
- [Becoming Employee Owned: A Small Business Toolkit](https://institute.coop/resources) - DAWI publication
- [Hawaii Business Magazine - Employee Stock Ownership](https://www.hawaiibusiness.com/employee-stock-ownership-esop-companies-hawaii/)

**Recommendation:** Engage professionals experienced in cooperative conversions early in the process. The Hawaii SBDC can provide referrals to appropriate advisors.

## 7. Common Pitfalls in Hawaii

### 1. Misunderstanding Hawaii's Tax Structure

Hawaii's General Excise Tax (GET) applies differently than traditional sales taxes in other states.

**Common Issues:**
- GET is imposed on gross income, not just retail sales
- Tax applies to business-to-business transactions
- County surcharges add to base 4% rate
- Cannot be separately stated on invoices like traditional sales tax (without disclosure)

**Solution:** Understand GET implications for your cooperative's business model. Factor the tax into pricing. Consult with a Hawaii tax professional familiar with GET requirements.

---

### 2. Choosing Wrong Cooperative Statute

Hawaii has two cooperative statutes with different purposes - Chapter 421 (Agricultural) and Chapter 421C (Consumer).

**Common Issues:**
- Using agricultural cooperative statute for non-agricultural worker cooperative
- Not understanding limitations of each statute
- Missing provisions that need to be addressed in bylaws

**Solution:**
- Evaluate whether your cooperative has agricultural purposes (Chapter 421) or other purposes (Chapter 421C)
- Consider LLC structure if neither cooperative statute fits well
- Consult with attorney familiar with Hawaii cooperative law

---

### 3. Inadequate Operating Agreement/Bylaws

Using generic templates or failing to address worker cooperative-specific issues creates legal and operational problems.

**Key Areas Often Overlooked:**
- Patronage calculation methodology
- Member buyout terms and timeline
- Dispute resolution procedures
- Decision-making authority levels
- Treatment of seasonal workers (common in Hawaii's tourism and agriculture sectors)

**Solution:** Work with an attorney familiar with worker cooperative law. Use resources from USFWC and DAWI as starting points, but customize for Hawaii and your specific situation.

---

### 4. Forgetting GET Registration and Compliance

Unlike states with no sales tax equivalent, Hawaii requires GET registration and ongoing compliance.

**Key Requirements:**
- $20 one-time registration fee
- Display license at place of business
- File periodic returns even if no tax due
- Understand county surcharge requirements

**Solution:** Register through Hawaii Tax Online immediately after formation. Set up systems for tracking and filing GET returns.

---

### 5. Inadequate Capitalization

Worker cooperatives often start undercapitalized because workers have limited personal wealth to invest, and traditional lenders may be unfamiliar with cooperative structures.

**Solution:**
- Develop realistic capital requirements before launch
- Consider phased membership buy-in over time (e.g., payroll deduction)
- Build collective reserves from retained earnings
- Explore SBA programs and cooperative-friendly lenders early
- Contact Hawaii SBDC for loan readiness assistance

---

### 6. Conflating Ownership with Daily Management

New worker cooperatives often assume all decisions must be made collectively, leading to inefficiency.

**Solution:** Clearly define in bylaws/operating agreement:
- Which decisions require full member vote
- Which decisions are delegated to board of directors
- Which decisions belong to managers or committees
- Create decision-making matrix for clarity

---

### 7. Not Planning for Seasonal Business Patterns

Many Hawaii businesses experience significant seasonal variation due to tourism and agricultural cycles.

**Common Issues:**
- Membership provisions don't address seasonal workers
- Cash flow for patronage distributions varies dramatically
- Inadequate reserves for slow periods

**Solution:**
- Address seasonal membership explicitly in bylaws
- Build adequate reserves for seasonal cash flow variations
- Consider how patronage is calculated for seasonal work patterns

---

### 8. Ignoring Multi-Island Logistics

For cooperatives operating across multiple islands, coordination challenges arise.

**Common Issues:**
- Registered agent must be in Hawaii but may be on different island
- Member meetings challenging with inter-island travel costs
- Different county regulations on different islands

**Solution:**
- Consider absentee voting provisions (permitted under HRS 421C-16)
- Use technology for member meetings where possible
- Understand county-specific requirements for each island location

---

## 8. FAQs for Hawaii

### Q1: Does Hawaii have a specific law for worker cooperatives?

**Partially.** Hawaii has two cooperative statutes - HRS Chapter 421 (Agricultural Cooperative Associations) and HRS Chapter 421C (Consumer Cooperative Associations). While neither is specifically designed for worker cooperatives, the Consumer Cooperative statute (Chapter 421C) can be adapted for worker ownership models.

Hawaii's legislature has explicitly recognized the importance of worker cooperatives, finding that they serve purposes including creating sustainable jobs, dignifying human work, and promoting community development. However, a dedicated worker cooperative statute has not yet been enacted.

Worker cooperatives in Hawaii typically either:
- Form under HRS 421C and adapt provisions for worker ownership
- Form under HRS 421 if engaged in agricultural activities
- Form as an LLC with a cooperative operating agreement
- Form as a standard corporation with cooperative bylaws

### Q2: What are the filing fees for forming a cooperative in Hawaii?

**Hawaii has very low filing fees:**

| Entity Type | Filing Fee |
|-------------|------------|
| Consumer Cooperative (nonprofit) | $25 |
| Agricultural Cooperative (nonprofit) | $25 |
| Limited Liability Company | $50 + $1 Archives fee |
| Domestic Profit Corporation | $50 |
| Name Reservation | $10 |
| Expedited Processing | $25 additional |

**Additional costs may include:**
- GET Registration: $20 (one-time)
- Attorney fees for document preparation: $2,000-$10,000+
- Registered agent service: $100-300/year (if using professional service)
- EIN application: Free

---

### Q3: What is the General Excise Tax and how does it affect my cooperative?

**Hawaii's GET is unique.** Unlike traditional sales taxes:

- GET is imposed on gross business income, not just retail sales
- Base rate is 4% for most activities (0.5% for wholesale)
- County surcharges add up to 0.5% depending on location
- Applies to business-to-business transactions
- Must register and display license
- Must file returns even if no tax due

**For cooperatives:** GET applies to your gross receipts. Factor this into pricing and financial planning. Patronage distributions to members are treated as adjustments to cost of doing business, not as GET-exempt.

---

### Q4: Can I form a worker cooperative as an LLC in Hawaii?

**Yes.** While Hawaii's cooperative statutes apply to corporations, an LLC can be structured with cooperative principles through its operating agreement. This includes:
- One-member-one-vote provisions
- Patronage-based distributions
- Democratic governance structures
- Member capital accounts

The LLC structure offers pass-through taxation and operational flexibility, making it popular for worker cooperatives. However, it lacks dedicated statutory guidance and cannot use "cooperative" in the entity name without potential confusion.

**Filing Fee:** $51 ($50 + $1 State Archives fee)

---

### Q5: What are the ongoing compliance requirements for Hawaii cooperatives?

**Key requirements:**

| Requirement | Frequency | Fee |
|-------------|-----------|-----|
| Annual Report (LLCs) | Annual | $12.50 online / $15 paper |
| Annual Report (Corporations) | Annual | Varies |
| GET Returns | Periodic + Annual | N/A |
| Business License Display | Continuous | N/A |

**Registered Agent:** Must maintain continuously with Hawaii physical address

**Initial Report (LLCs):** Due within 60 days of formation

**Yes.** Hawaii has a growing cooperative tradition:

**Agricultural Cooperatives:**

**ESOP Companies (employee ownership examples):**
- Roberts Hawaii, The Solaray Corporation, Bowers + Kubota Consulting, and approximately 65 other ESOP businesses

---

### Q8: How does Hawaii's cultural context support worker cooperatives?

**Strong alignment exists.** Hawaii's cultural values often align with cooperative principles:

- **Ohana (Family):** Collective responsibility and mutual support
- **Kokua (Help):** Community assistance and cooperation
- **Malama (Care):** Stewardship of resources and community
- **Aloha Spirit:** Mutual regard and affection in relationships

Worker cooperatives can embody these values through:
- Democratic ownership by those who do the work
- Keeping wealth circulating within island communities
- Preserving local business ownership
- Creating sustainable, dignified employment

Hawaii's legislature has recognized that worker cooperatives promote community and local development, aligning economic structures with cultural values.
