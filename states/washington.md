## 1. Quick Summary: What Makes Washington Unique

Washington State stands out as one of the most supportive environments for worker cooperatives in the United States. Here are the key factors that make it distinctive:

### No State Income Tax
Washington has **no personal or corporate state income tax**, which simplifies tax planning for worker-owners. Instead, the state relies on the Business & Occupation (B&O) tax—a gross receipts tax on business activities. This structure can be advantageous for cooperatives distributing patronage dividends to members.

### Strong Cooperative Ecosystem in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest
The Puget Sound region, particularly Seattle, has a vibrant cooperative culture. While Seattle is home to major consumer cooperatives like [REI](https://www.rei.com/) and [PCC Community Markets](https://www.pcc.coop/), worker cooperatives are growing in visibility. Notable worker co-ops include Equal Exchange Cafe, New Seattle Massage (operating for over 30 years), The Patty Pan Cooperative, and Metis Construction.

### Dedicated Employee Ownership Program (WA-EOP)
Washington became one of the first states to establish a comprehensive [Employee Ownership Program](https://www.commerce.wa.gov/access-to-capital/wa-eop/) through Senate Bill 5096, signed into law in 2023. This program provides:
- A dedicated director housed in the Department of Commerce
- B&O tax credits for conversion costs
- A revolving loan fund for cooperative conversions
- Technical assistance and outreach

### Multiple Legal Entity Options
Washington offers several distinct statutory frameworks for forming worker cooperatives under [RCW Title 23](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?Cite=23&pdf=true):
- Employee Cooperative Corporations (RCW 23.78)
- Cooperative Associations (RCW 23.86)
- Limited Cooperative Associations (RCW 23.100)
- LLC structures with cooperative operating agreements

### Regional Networks
Washington benefits from established cooperative networks, including a Bellingham-based co-op of cooperatives serving Whatcom, Skagit, and Cascade Counties; an Olympia-based co-op of cooperatives in the South Puget Sound region; and a Port Townsend-based network connecting cooperatives in Clallam, Jefferson, and Kitsap counties.

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives in Washington

Washington provides multiple pathways for structuring a worker cooperative. Your choice depends on factors including membership structure, capital needs, governance preferences, and tax considerations.

### Option A: Employee Cooperative Corporation (RCW 23.78)

[Chapter 23.78 RCW](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=23.78&full=true) is Washington's dedicated statute for worker cooperatives organized as corporations.

**Key Features:**
- **Membership shares**: Each member owns exactly one membership share with voting rights; only members (employees) may own these shares
- **Patronage-based distribution**: Net earnings are apportioned to members based on their patronage (work performed), not capital contributions
- **One-member, one-vote**: Capital stock other than membership shares cannot be given voting power (with limited exceptions)
- **Internal capital accounts**: The statute permits establishing internal capital accounts to track each member's equity
- **Name inclusion**: May include "cooperative" or "co-op" in the corporate name
- **Formation**: Elect to be governed under RCW 23.78 by stating so in articles of incorporation

**Best For:** Groups seeking a traditional corporate structure with clear statutory guidance specifically designed for worker ownership.

**Considerations:**
- Governed by Title 23B RCW (Business Corporation Act) with specific exceptions
- Merger limitations: Can only merge with other employee cooperatives
- More formal corporate governance requirements

### Option B: Cooperative Association (RCW 23.86)

[Chapter 23.86 RCW](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=23.86&full=true) provides a flexible framework for cooperative associations.

**Key Features:**
- **Broad eligibility**: "Any number of persons may associate themselves together as a cooperative association...for the transaction of any lawful business on the cooperative plan"
- **Flexibility**: Can be formed with or without capital stock
- **Membership structure**: Determined by articles and bylaws
- **Filing**: Articles of incorporation filed with Secretary of State per RCW 23.95

**Best For:** Groups wanting flexibility in cooperative structure and membership arrangements.

### Option C: Limited Cooperative Association (RCW 23.100)

[Chapter 23.100 RCW](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=23.100&full=true) governs Limited Cooperative Associations (LCAs), a hybrid structure combining cooperative principles with investor-friendly features.

**Key Features:**
- **Unincorporated association**: Organized as an autonomous association, not a corporation
- **Dual membership classes**: Permits both patron members (workers) and investor members
- **Flexible capital structure**: Allows outside investment while maintaining cooperative control
- **Pass-through taxation**: Can elect partnership taxation for federal purposes
- **Required name format**: Must include "Limited Cooperative Association," "Limited Cooperative," "L.C.A.," or "LCA" (with permitted abbreviations)

**Required Articles of Organization Contents:**
1. Name of the LCA (compliant with naming requirements)
2. Purposes for which the association is formed
3. Street and mailing addresses of the initial registered agent in Washington
4. Street and mailing addresses of the initial principal office
5. Name and addresses of each organizer
6. Term of existence (if other than perpetual)

**Best For:** Worker cooperatives needing outside investment capital while maintaining democratic worker control.

### Option D: Limited Liability Company (LLC) with Cooperative Operating Agreement

While LLCs cannot use "cooperative" in their name per [RCW 23.95.305](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=23.95.305), they can operate on cooperative principles through a carefully drafted operating agreement.

**Key Features:**
- **Flexibility**: Operating agreement can establish one-member-one-vote governance and patronage-based allocations
- **Pass-through taxation**: Default partnership taxation (or S-corp election)
- **Limited liability**: Members protected from business debts
- **Simpler compliance**: Fewer formal corporate requirements

**LLC Formation Requirements:**
- Certificate of Formation filed with [Washington Secretary of State](https://www.sos.wa.gov/corporations-charities/business-entities/limited-liability-company-llc-professional-llc-pllc-filing-resource-page)
- Filing fee: $180 (mail) or $200 (online)
- Name must include "Limited Liability Company," "Limited Liability Co.," "L.L.C.," or "LLC"
- Cannot include "cooperative" in the name

**Best For:** Groups wanting operational flexibility, simpler compliance, and pass-through taxation, who are comfortable without "cooperative" in the business name.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Employee Coop Corp (23.78) | Coop Association (23.86) | LCA (23.100) | LLC (Coop-style) |

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

- Employee retention during transition

**For Workers:**
- Job preservation and stability
- Wealth-building opportunity
- Democratic control over workplace
- Shared prosperity from business success

### Washington's Conversion Support Infrastructure

## 7. Common Pitfalls in Washington

### Legal and Structural Pitfalls

**1. Choosing the Wrong Entity Structure**
- **Mistake**: Defaulting to LLC without understanding cooperative-specific statutes
- **Impact**: May lose statutory protections, tax benefits, or ability to use "cooperative" in name
- **Prevention**: Consult with attorney familiar with RCW 23.78, 23.86, and 23.100; consider Employee Cooperative Corporation for clear statutory framework

**2. Inadequate Governing Documents**
- **Mistake**: Using generic templates not designed for Washington law or worker cooperatives
- **Impact**: Ambiguity in governance, patronage calculations, or member rights
- **Prevention**: Work with cooperative-experienced attorney; consider NWCDC resources for Washington-specific guidance

**3. Failing to Maintain Cooperative Principles in Practice**
- **Mistake**: Adopting cooperative structure but operating like a traditional business
- **Impact**: May jeopardize cooperative tax treatment; undermines member engagement
- **Prevention**: Regular governance training; active member participation; transparent financial reporting

### Financial and Tax Pitfalls

**4. Misunderstanding Washington's B&O Tax**
- **Mistake**: Assuming no state income tax means no state business taxes
- **Impact**: Unexpected tax liability on gross receipts; potential penalties
- **Prevention**: Register with [Department of Revenue](https://dor.wa.gov/open-business/apply-business-license) immediately; understand B&O classifications and rates

**5. Improper Patronage Allocation**
- **Mistake**: Failing to properly document patronage allocations or make timely payments
- **Impact**: Loss of Subchapter T tax benefits; potential IRS issues
- **Prevention**: Establish clear patronage tracking from day one; work with CPA experienced in cooperative taxation

**6. Undercapitalization**
- **Mistake**: Starting with insufficient capital or relying too heavily on debt
- **Impact**: Cash flow problems; inability to weather downturns; pressure on worker-owners
- **Prevention**: Realistic financial projections; adequate member equity contributions; access to patient capital sources

**7. Neglecting Local Tax Obligations**
- **Mistake**: Registering with state but missing city/county requirements
- **Impact**: Seattle B&O tax (separate from state); local licensing penalties
- **Prevention**: Research requirements for all jurisdictions where you operate; Seattle businesses must obtain [Seattle Business License Tax Certificate](https://www.seattle.gov/city-finance/business-taxes-and-licenses/business-licenses)

### Governance Pitfalls

**8. Conflating Ownership with Day-to-Day Management**
- **Mistake**: Assuming all decisions require full member vote; or allowing management to bypass member governance
- **Impact**: Slow decision-making; governance paralysis; or erosion of democratic principles
- **Prevention**: Clear delegation of authority in bylaws; distinguish strategic decisions (member/board) from operational decisions (management)

**9. Inadequate Conflict Resolution Processes**
- **Mistake**: No clear procedures for handling disputes among members
- **Impact**: Conflicts escalate; potential for expensive litigation; damaged relationships
- **Prevention**: Include robust dispute resolution provisions in bylaws; consider mediation requirements before litigation

**10. Failing to Plan for Member Transitions**
- **Mistake**: No clear process for member departure, share redemption, or new member admission
- **Impact**: Liquidity problems when members leave; difficulty onboarding new workers
- **Prevention**: Detailed membership provisions in bylaws; capital account policies; reasonable redemption terms

### Operational Pitfalls

**11. Insufficient Member Education and Onboarding**
- **Mistake**: Admitting members without adequate training in cooperative principles and responsibilities
- **Impact**: Disengaged members; poor meeting attendance; governance challenges
- **Prevention**: Formal orientation program; probationary period before full membership; ongoing education

**12. Ignoring Available Resources**
- **Mistake**: Trying to figure everything out alone
- **Impact**: Reinventing the wheel; missing funding opportunities; avoidable mistakes
- **Prevention**: Engage [NWCDC](https://nwcdc.coop/) early; utilize [WA-EOP](https://www.commerce.wa.gov/access-to-capital/wa-eop/) resources; connect with Washington SBDC; join [USFWC](https://www.usworker.coop/)

**13. Not Claiming Available Tax Credits**
- **Mistake**: Completing a conversion without applying for B&O tax credit
- **Impact**: Leaving up to $25,000 on the table
- **Prevention**: Apply for [employee ownership B&O tax credit](https://dor.wa.gov/forms-publications/publications-subject/special-notices/employee-ownership-program-bo-tax-credit) for eligible conversion costs

- **Limited Cooperative Association (RCW 23.100)**: Yes, must include "Limited Cooperative Association," "Limited Cooperative," "L.C.A.," or "LCA"

### Q2: Does Washington have a state income tax that will affect our cooperative?

**Answer**: No. Washington has no personal or corporate income tax. However, Washington does impose the **Business & Occupation (B&O) tax**, which is a gross receipts tax on business activities. This means you pay tax on your total business income before expenses, not on profits. B&O tax rates vary by business classification, with service businesses paying 1.5% to 2.1% depending on gross income levels.

Additionally, Seattle and some other cities impose their own B&O taxes, separate from the state tax.

### Q3: What tax credits are available for forming or converting to a worker cooperative in Washington?

**Answer**: Washington offers a **B&O tax credit** for businesses converting to worker cooperative ownership:
- Credit covers up to **50% of conversion costs**
- Maximum credit of **$25,000** for worker cooperatives and employee ownership trusts
- Eligible costs include professional services, legal fees, accounting, and valuation expenses
- Annual program cap of $2 million

To claim this credit, contact Washington Department of Revenue Taxpayer Account Administration at (360) 705-6214.

### Q4: Where can I get help starting a worker cooperative in Washington?

**Answer**: Washington has robust support resources:

**Primary Resource:**
- **Northwest Cooperative Development Center (NWCDC)**: The primary cooperative development organization for Washington since 1979. Offers feasibility assessment, business planning, formation assistance, and financing. Contact: (360) 943-4241 or visit [nwcdc.coop](https://nwcdc.coop/)

**State Programs:**
- **Washington Employee Ownership Program (WA-EOP)**: State program providing outreach, technical assistance, and coordination. Visit [commerce.wa.gov/access-to-capital/wa-eop/](https://www.commerce.wa.gov/access-to-capital/wa-eop/)

**Business Development:**
- **Washington SBDC**: Free business advising through 35+ locations statewide. Visit [wsbdc.org](https://wsbdc.org/)

### Q5: How much does it cost to form a worker cooperative in Washington?

**Answer**: Basic government filing fees include:
- **Formation filing with Secretary of State**: $180 (mail) or $200 (online); expedited processing adds $100
- **Initial Report**: $10 (due within 120 days)
- **State Business License**: $19
- **EIN**: Free (from IRS)
- **Annual Report**: $70 per year

Additional costs may include:
- Legal fees for document drafting (varies; $2,000-$10,000+)
- Accounting setup and consultation
- Local business licenses (varies by jurisdiction)
- Seattle Business License: If applicable

Total startup costs vary widely based on complexity and professional assistance needed. The B&O tax credit can offset up to $25,000 of professional costs for conversions.

### Q6: Can our worker cooperative get loans without personal guarantees in Washington?

**Answer**: Yes, Washington's employee ownership legislation (SB 5096) specifically provides that loans from the state's revolving loan fund for worker cooperative conversions **shall not require personal or entity guarantees**. Lending guidelines allow for:
- Cash flow-based underwriting
- Character-based lending
- Reliance on business assets

Additionally, some cooperative-focused lenders like [Shared Capital Cooperative](https://sharedcapital.coop/) and NWCDC's loan fund offer cooperative-friendly terms.

### Q7: What ongoing compliance requirements apply to Washington worker cooperatives?

**Answer**: Key ongoing requirements include:

**Secretary of State:**
- **Annual Report**: Due on your anniversary date each year; $70 filing fee; $25 late fee if delinquent

**Department of Revenue:**
- **B&O Tax**: Filed monthly, quarterly, or annually based on business volume
- **Sales Tax**: If applicable to your business, collected and remitted per filing schedule
- **Business License Renewal**: As required

**Local:**
- **City Business License Renewal**: Seattle licenses expire December 31 annually
- **Other local permits**: Per jurisdiction requirements

**Internal Cooperative:**
- Annual member meeting
- Board elections per bylaws
- Patronage allocation decisions
- Financial reporting to members
- Federal tax returns (Form 1120-C or applicable form)

### Q8: How do we handle patronage dividends for tax purposes?

**Answer**: Worker cooperatives typically operate under **Subchapter T** of the Internal Revenue Code, which allows the cooperative to deduct patronage dividends paid to members. Key points:

- **Patronage definition**: Based on work performed (labor patronage), not capital contribution
- **Written notice requirement**: Members must receive written notice of allocations
- **Timing**: Allocations must be made within 8.5 months after fiscal year-end
- **Member taxation**: Members report patronage income on their personal tax returns
- **Cash vs. retained**: Cooperatives can pay some patronage in cash and retain some as allocated capital

Washington has no state income tax, so patronage dividends are only subject to federal tax treatment (plus any local B&O tax implications). Work with a CPA experienced in cooperative taxation to ensure proper compliance.
