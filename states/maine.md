---

## 1. Quick Summary

**What Makes Maine Unique for Worker Cooperatives:**

Maine stands out as one of the most cooperative-friendly states in the United States, with a long tradition of cooperative enterprise and robust support infrastructure. The state has enacted specific legislation for **Employee Cooperative Corporations** under [Title 13, Chapter 85, Subchapter 3](https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/13/title13ch85sec0.html) of the Maine Revised Statutes, providing a dedicated legal framework for worker-owned businesses.

Key distinguishing features include:

- **Dedicated Employee Cooperative Corporation statute** - Maine is among the few states with explicit statutory provisions for worker cooperatives (Sections 1971-1984)
- **Strong cooperative culture** - The state hosts numerous successful worker cooperatives, consumer co-ops, and multi-stakeholder cooperatives across diverse sectors
- **State tax incentives** - Legislation (LD 1520) provides tax benefits for business owners selling to worker cooperatives, excluding up to $750,000 of gain from Maine income tax
- **Active support ecosystem** - Multiple organizations including Cooperative Development Institute, Cooperative Maine Business Alliance, and Maine SBDC provide technical assistance
- **Business succession focus** - Maine faces a significant "Silver Tsunami" with the average business owner age at 60, creating strong impetus for cooperative conversions

**Common Entity Choices:**

1. **Employee Cooperative Corporation** (Title 13, Chapter 85) - Purpose-built for worker ownership
2. **Limited Liability Company (LLC)** with cooperative operating agreement - Flexible alternative
3. **Standard Business Corporation** (Title 13-C) with cooperative bylaws - Less common but viable

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives in Maine

### Employee Cooperative Corporation (Recommended)

Maine's Employee Cooperative Corporation statute ([Title 13, Sections 1971-1984](https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/13/title13ch85sec0.html)) provides a dedicated legal framework specifically designed for worker-owned businesses.

**Key Statutory Provisions:**

| Section | Topic | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1971 | Title | Establishes the "Employee Cooperative Corporations" subchapter |
| 1972 | Definitions | Defines key terms including "employee cooperative corporation" and "patronage" |
| 1973 | Application of other laws | Clarifies relationship with Maine Business Corporation Act |
| 1974 | Registration of securities | Securities law exemptions and requirements |
| 1975 | Formation and revocation | How to elect employee cooperative status |
| 1976 | Use of "cooperative" or "co-op" | Name usage requirements and protections |
| 1977 | Membership | Membership eligibility and rights |
| 1978 | Membership shares and fees | Share structure and capital contributions |
| 1979 | Amendment of bylaws | Procedures for changing governing documents |
| 1980 | Earnings or losses | Allocation of financial results |
| 1981 | Accounting for earnings or losses | Financial recordkeeping requirements |
| 1982 | Internal capital account cooperatives | Capital account structures |
| 1983 | Revocation of election | How to dissolve cooperative status |
| 1984 | Mergers | Combining cooperative entities |

**Advantages:**
- Purpose-built legal framework for worker ownership
- Statutory protections for democratic governance (one member, one vote)
- Clear guidance on patronage-based allocations
- Protection of "cooperative" and "co-op" terminology
- Securities law considerations addressed
- Established conversion and merger procedures

**Considerations:**
- Must contact Secretary of State directly for formation documents (not available online)
- Less flexibility than LLC structure
- May require more formality in governance

### LLC with Cooperative Operating Agreement

A Limited Liability Company can be structured as a worker cooperative through a carefully drafted operating agreement.

**Formation Documents:**
- [Certificate of Formation (Form MLLC-6)](https://www.maine.gov/sos/corporations-commissions/i-need-a-business-form/limited-liability-company-forms) - $175 filing fee
- Operating Agreement (internal document, not filed with state)

**Advantages:**
- Greater flexibility in structuring governance and profit-sharing
- Familiar legal form for attorneys and accountants
- Pass-through taxation by default
- Members can be classified as employees or partners
- Easier to modify operating agreement as business evolves

**Key Operating Agreement Provisions for Cooperative LLCs:**
- One member, one vote governance (must be explicitly stated)
- Patronage-based profit allocation (based on hours worked or labor contribution)
- Membership eligibility tied to employment
- Capital contribution requirements
- Buy-back provisions for departing members
- Democratic decision-making procedures

**Considerations:**
- Must explicitly codify cooperative principles in operating agreement
- Future members could potentially amend away cooperative structure
- Cannot use "cooperative" or "co-op" in name without complying with cooperative statutes
- Operating agreement complexity increases legal costs

**Sample Operating Agreement Language:**

While not legal advice, a cooperative LLC operating agreement typically includes provisions such as:
- "Voting rights shall be allocated on the basis of one member, one vote, regardless of capital contribution"
- "Net profits and losses shall be allocated to members based on patronage (hours worked) rather than capital contributions"
- "Membership shall be limited to individuals who are employees of the Company"

### Standard Business Corporation with Cooperative Bylaws

A Maine Business Corporation ([Title 13-C](https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/13-c/title13-Cch0sec0.html)) can adopt bylaws that incorporate cooperative principles.

**Considerations:**
- Less common for worker cooperatives
- Corporation structure may conflict with cooperative principles
- May be useful for specific situations (e.g., seeking certain investors)
- Articles of incorporation: $145 filing fee

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

### The Business Succession Opportunity in Maine

Maine faces a significant business succession challenge:
- Average age of business owners nationally: 50 years
- Average age of business owners in Maine: **60 years**
- Approximately 32,000 small businesses employ over half of Maine's workers
- 75% of business owners are baby boomers with few concrete succession plans

This creates substantial opportunity for worker cooperative conversions as a succession strategy.

### How Cooperative Conversions Typically Work

**Process Overview:**

1. **Exploration Phase**
   - Business owner expresses interest in selling to employees
   - Initial contact with CDI's Business Ownership Solutions program
   - Preliminary feasibility assessment

2. **Feasibility Study**
   - Business valuation
   - Financial analysis
   - Worker interest assessment
   - Market and operational review

3. **Structure Design**
   - Determine cooperative structure (corporation vs. LLC)
   - Design ownership and governance model
   - Plan capital structure and buy-in terms

4. **Financing**
   - Work with CDFIs (CFNE, CEI) and traditional lenders
   - Seller financing often plays a role
   - Member capital contributions

5. **Education and Training**
   - Worker-members learn cooperative governance
   - Financial literacy training
   - Leadership development

6. **Transaction Execution**
   - Legal documentation
   - Closing and ownership transfer
   - Transition period with former owner (often)

### ESOP vs. Worker Cooperative Conversion

| Factor | ESOP | Worker Cooperative |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| **Governance** | Stock ownership; may or may not have voting rights | Democratic control; one member, one vote |
| **Setup Cost** | $40,000+ | Generally lower |
| **Annual Maintenance** | $15,000-30,000 | Significantly lower |
| **Minimum Size** | Typically 15-20+ employees to be cost-effective | Suitable for smaller businesses |
| **Tax Benefits (Federal)** | Significant (1042 rollover, deductible contributions) | 1042 rollover available for C-corps |
| **Maine Tax Benefits** | Up to $750,000 gain excluded | Up to $750,000 gain excluded |
| **Complexity** | High (ERISA-regulated retirement plan) | Lower |
| **Worker Control** | Variable | Central feature |

**Maine-Specific Tax Benefits (LD 1520):**
- Excludes from Maine income tax up to $750,000 of gain recognized by a business owner selling to an ESOP or worker cooperative
- Excludes interest from loans financing such transfers

### Notable Maine Conversion Examples

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q1: Does Maine have a specific statute for worker cooperatives?

**A:** Yes. Maine has the Employee Cooperative Corporations statute under [Title 13, Chapter 85, Subchapter 3 (Sections 1971-1984)](https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/13/title13ch85sec0.html). This provides a dedicated legal framework for worker-owned businesses, addressing membership, voting, patronage allocations, capital accounts, and governance. Maine is among the minority of states with such specific legislation.

### Q2: How do I get the formation documents for an Employee Cooperative Corporation?

**A:** Unlike standard corporations and LLCs, cooperative formation documents are not available for download on the Maine Secretary of State website. You must contact the Division of Corporations directly at **(207) 624-7752** to obtain the appropriate forms. Plan ahead, as current processing times are 35-40 business days for standard filings.

### Q3: Can I form a worker cooperative as an LLC instead of using the cooperative corporation statute?

**A:** Yes. An LLC with a comprehensive operating agreement can function as a worker cooperative. The operating agreement must explicitly establish cooperative principles: one member, one vote governance; patronage-based profit distribution; and membership tied to employment. However, note that without complying with cooperative statutes, you typically cannot use "cooperative" or "co-op" in your business name.

### Q4: What are the filing fees for forming a worker cooperative in Maine?

**A:** Fees depend on entity type:
- **Employee Cooperative Corporation:** Contact Secretary of State for current fee
- **LLC:** $175 for Certificate of Formation
- **Name Reservation (optional):** $20 (120 days)
- **Expedited Processing:** Additional $50 (24-hour) or $100 (immediate)
- **Annual Report:** $85 (domestic), due by June 1 each year

### Q5: Are there tax benefits for selling a business to a worker cooperative in Maine?

**A:** Yes. Maine legislation (LD 1520) provides that business owners selling to an eligible worker-owned cooperative can exclude up to $750,000 of gain from Maine income tax. Additionally, interest from loans financing such transfers is excluded from Maine income tax. At the federal level, the 1042 rollover may apply for C-corporation sales. Consult a tax professional for specific advice.

### Q6: What support organizations help with worker cooperatives in Maine?

**A:** Maine has robust cooperative support infrastructure:
- **Cooperative Development Institute (CDI)** - Technical assistance, feasibility studies, conversions
- **Business Ownership Solutions** - CDI program focused on Maine conversions
- **Cooperative Maine Business Alliance** - Networking, advocacy, events
- **Maine SBDC** - General business advising
- **Cooperative Fund of the Northeast** - Financing
- **Coastal Enterprises, Inc. (CEI)** - Financing

### Q7: How long does it take to form a worker cooperative in Maine?

**A:** Timeline varies based on complexity:
- **Name reservation:** Immediate to 40 business days
- **Formation filing:** 35-40 business days (standard); faster with expedited processing
- **EIN:** Immediate (online)
- **State tax registration:** ~20 days for account number

The full formation process, including developing governing documents, typically takes 3-6 months. Conversions of existing businesses often take 1-3 years.

### Q8: What's the minimum number of people needed to form a worker cooperative in Maine?

**A:** There is no explicit statutory minimum for Employee Cooperative Corporations, but practically, worker cooperatives typically need at least 2-3 founding worker-members to function effectively. Some organizations recommend 3-5 committed founders. For LLCs, Maine allows single-member LLCs, but this would defeat the cooperative purpose.
