# How to Start a Worker Cooperative in Montana

Montana offers a distinctive environment for worker cooperatives, combining a rich history of cooperative enterprises with modernized statutes and strong rural community support networks. This guide provides a comprehensive roadmap for forming a worker cooperative in the Treasure State.

---

## Quick Summary

### What Makes Montana Unique for Worker Cooperatives

Montana presents several distinguishing characteristics for cooperative business development:

- **Modernized Cooperative Statutes**: Montana's cooperative laws (MCA Title 35, Chapter 15) were updated in the late 1990s thanks to advocacy by Big Timberworks, making them more applicable to modern worker cooperatives rather than just agricultural associations.

- **Strong Rural Cooperative Tradition**: Montana has a robust history of cooperatives, particularly in agriculture, utilities, and grocery stores. Rural communities facing grocery store closures have increasingly turned to cooperative ownership models.

- **Dedicated State Support**: Montana has its own [Montana Cooperative Development Center (MCDC)](https://mcdc.coop/), a state-recognized organization providing no-cost to low-cost technical assistance for cooperative formation.

- **Low Filing Fees**: Montana offers some of the lowest business filing fees in the nation, with Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen having cut registration fees in half and waived annual report fees for consecutive years.

- **No State General Business License**: Montana does not require a general state business license, simplifying the regulatory environment (though local licenses may still apply).

### Common Entity Choices for Worker Cooperatives

Montana worker cooperatives typically organize under one of these structures:

| Structure | Best For | Key Characteristics |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Cooperative Association (MCA 35-15)** | Traditional cooperatives with capital stock | Montana-specific statute; democratic governance; patronage dividends |
| **Limited Liability Company (LLC)** | Flexible governance; pass-through taxation | Customizable operating agreement; liability protection; widely used nationally |
| **Corporation (C-Corp or S-Corp)** | Larger cooperatives; outside investment potential | More complex governance; may elect Subchapter T treatment |

## Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives in Montana

### Option 1: Cooperative Association Under MCA Title 35, Chapter 15

Montana's [Cooperative Associations statute (MCA 35-15)](https://archive.legmt.gov/bills/mca/title_0350/chapter_0150/parts_index.html) provides a dedicated legal framework for forming cooperatives.

**Key Provisions:**

- **Formation Requirements (Part 2)**: Articles of incorporation must be filed with the Secretary of State, followed by issuance of a license to open books for subscription to capital stock.

- **One Member, One Vote**: Section 35-15-202 limits subscription or control of common stock, typically ensuring one share per person to maintain democratic control.

- **Shareholder Meetings (Section 35-15-302)**: Annual meetings must be held within 6 months after fiscal year close. Quorum requirements: 10% of the first 100 stockholders plus 5% of additional stockholders, unless bylaws specify otherwise.

- **Patronage Dividends**: The statute accommodates distribution of surplus based on patronage (work contributed) rather than capital invested.

**Advantages:**
- Purpose-built for cooperative business models
- Clear statutory framework for democratic governance
- Recognition as a cooperative for regulatory and tax purposes

**Considerations:**
- May be less familiar to attorneys and accountants
- Capital stock structure may not suit all worker cooperative models

### Option 2: Worker Cooperative LLC

The [Montana Limited Liability Company Act (MCA 35-8)](https://archive.legmt.gov/bills/mca/title_0350/chapter_0080/parts_index.html) allows significant flexibility in structuring an LLC operating agreement to function as a worker cooperative.

**Key Features:**

- **Operating Agreement Flexibility**: Under [MCA 35-8-109](https://archive.legmt.gov/bills/mca/title_0350/chapter_0080/part_0010/section_0090/0350-0080-0010-0090.html), members may establish rules governing voting, profit allocation, management, and dissolution through a customized operating agreement.

- **Member-Managed Structure**: A member-managed LLC aligns with democratic worker cooperative principles where all worker-owners participate in decision-making.

- **Pass-Through Taxation**: Default taxation as a partnership avoids double taxation, with profits and losses passing through to individual members.

**Advantages:**
- Widely recognized and understood legal structure
- Maximum flexibility in governance design
- Strong liability protection
- Abundant professional resources and templates available

**Considerations:**
- Requires careful drafting of operating agreement to establish cooperative principles
- Not automatically recognized as a "cooperative" without proper documentation

### Option 3: Cooperative Corporation

Montana worker cooperatives may also organize as corporations under [MCA 35-14 (Montana Business Corporation Act)](https://archive.legmt.gov/bills/mca/title_0350/chapter_0140/parts_index.html) while adopting cooperative governance principles and electing Subchapter T tax treatment with the IRS.

**When This Structure Makes Sense:**
- Larger worker cooperatives with substantial capital needs
- Cooperatives planning to issue multiple classes of stock
- Situations requiring familiar corporate governance structures

## Worker-Ownership Conversions

### Montana Success Story: Big Timberworks

[Big Timberworks](https://project-equity.org/ownership-story/big-timberworks/), a design/build construction firm in Gallatin Gateway, Montana, provides a model for successful worker cooperative conversion:

**Background:**
- Founded in 1983 as a sole proprietorship
- Specializes in timber-frame construction, woodwork, metalwork, stonework
- Converted to worker-owned cooperative in 1999
- Currently has 11 worker-owners

**Conversion Process:**
1. Founder Merle Adams sought a succession solution that protected employees
2. Worked with the ICA Group and modeled after South Mountain Company
3. Developed an 8-year buyout plan
4. Adams initially retained land ownership while selling buildings and equipment to make transition financially feasible
5. Hired attorney and accountant specializing in cooperative law

**Legacy Impact:**
Big Timberworks lobbied for updates to Montana's cooperative statutes, which had not been revised since the 1920s. This effort modernized the law for all future Montana worker cooperatives.

### Steps for Converting an Existing Business

**Phase 1: Assessment**
1. Evaluate business financial health and valuation
2. Assess employee interest and readiness for ownership
3. Identify legal structure options (cooperative association, LLC, or S-Corp/ESOP)
4. Engage advisors experienced in cooperative conversions

**Phase 2: Planning**
1. Determine fair market value through professional appraisal
2. Design ownership transition structure
3. Develop financing plan (seller financing, bank loans, SBA loans, patient capital)
4. Draft governance documents reflecting cooperative principles

**Phase 3: Execution**
1. Form the cooperative entity
2. Execute purchase agreements and financing documents
3. Transfer ownership progressively or in a single transaction
4. Implement member education and governance training

### Financing Conversion Options

| Source | Description | Typical Terms |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Seller Financing** | Departing owner carries note | Flexible; often essential for feasibility |
| **Bank Loans** | Traditional commercial lending | Market rates; collateral required |
| **SBA 7(a) Loans** | Government-guaranteed small business loans | Up to $5 million; favorable terms |
| **CDFI Loans** | Mission-driven lenders | Patient capital; may accept higher risk |
| **Internal Equity** | Member buy-in contributions | Builds commitment; limited capital |

## Common Pitfalls in Montana

### Legal and Formation Issues

**1. Choosing the Wrong Entity Structure**
- *Problem*: Selecting a structure based solely on cost without considering governance needs
- *Solution*: Consult with MCDC and an attorney to match structure to your cooperative's specific goals

**2. Inadequate Bylaws or Operating Agreements**
- *Problem*: Using generic templates that do not address cooperative-specific issues
- *Solution*: Work with cooperative-experienced professionals; MCDC offers bylaw review services

**3. Failing to Maintain Registered Agent**
- *Problem*: Letting registered agent lapse leads to missed legal notices and potential dissolution
- *Solution*: Set calendar reminders; consider commercial registered agent service for reliability

### Governance Challenges

**4. Insufficient Member Education**
- *Problem*: Worker-owners unprepared for dual role as employees and owners
- *Solution*: Implement ongoing governance training; establish clear onboarding process for new members

**5. Unclear Patronage Allocation Policies**
- *Problem*: Disputes over how surplus is calculated and distributed
- *Solution*: Document policies clearly in bylaws; communicate transparently with members

**6. Neglecting Board Development**
- *Problem*: Board members lack skills for effective governance
- *Solution*: Provide board training; consider advisory board with outside expertise

### Financial Pitfalls

**7. Undercapitalization**
- *Problem*: Starting without sufficient working capital
- *Solution*: Develop realistic financial projections; explore multiple funding sources

**8. Ignoring Tax Compliance**
- *Problem*: Failing to properly report patronage dividends or file required returns
- *Solution*: Work with accountant familiar with Subchapter T; file [Form 1099-PATR](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-patr) as required

### Compliance Issues

**9. Missing Annual Report Deadline**
- *Problem*: Failure to file by April 15 results in penalties; failure to file by November 28 results in dissolution
- *Solution*: Calendar the deadline; take advantage of fee waivers when available

**10. Overlooking Local Licensing Requirements**
- *Problem*: Assuming no state license means no licenses required
- *Solution*: Contact your city and county offices to verify local requirements

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for Montana

### 1. Does Montana have a specific worker cooperative statute?

Montana does not have a statute specifically titled "worker cooperative," but the [Cooperative Associations statute (MCA 35-15)](https://archive.legmt.gov/bills/mca/title_0350/chapter_0150/parts_index.html) can accommodate worker cooperatives. The statute was modernized in the late 1990s through advocacy by Big Timberworks. Alternatively, many Montana worker cooperatives organize as LLCs with cooperative operating agreements.

### 2. How much does it cost to form a worker cooperative in Montana?

Basic formation costs are relatively low:
- Cooperative Association Articles of Incorporation: $20
- LLC Articles of Organization: $70 (online)
- Name Reservation (optional): $10
- Annual Report: Typically $20 (waived for 2024 and 2025)

Additional costs may include attorney fees, accounting services, and technical assistance beyond MCDC's free offerings.

### 3. What is the Montana Cooperative Development Center (MCDC), and how can they help?

[MCDC](https://mcdc.coop/) is Montana's state-recognized cooperative development organization, providing no-cost to low-cost technical assistance including: facilitation, bylaw and articles review, membership development guidance, and financial consulting. They serve all 56 Montana counties and seven tribal reservations. Contact them early in your formation process.

### 4. Do I need a business license to operate a worker cooperative in Montana?

Montana does not require a general state business license. However, many cities and counties require local business licenses. Additionally, certain professions and industries require state-level occupational licenses. Check with your local municipality and relevant state agencies for specific requirements.

### 5. How are worker cooperatives taxed in Montana?

At the federal level, cooperatives operating under Subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code can deduct patronage dividends distributed to members, avoiding double taxation on those amounts. Members report patronage dividends as income on their personal returns. Montana generally follows federal tax treatment, but consult the [Montana Department of Revenue](https://revenue.mt.gov/) and a tax professional for specific guidance on state treatment.

### 6. Can an existing Montana business convert to a worker cooperative?

Yes. Montana businesses can convert to worker cooperatives, as demonstrated by Big Timberworks' successful 1999 conversion. The process typically involves business valuation, legal restructuring, financing the buyout, and member education. Resources include [Project Equity](https://project-equity.org/), the [Democracy at Work Institute](https://institute.coop/our-work/workers-owners-conversions), and MCDC.

### 7. What happens if we miss the annual report deadline?

If you miss the April 15 deadline, a $15 late fee applies. You can still file late until 5:00 PM on November 28. If you fail to file by that date, your business will be involuntarily dissolved by the Secretary of State on December 1. File through the [Montana Secretary of State portal](https://sosmt.gov/business/).

### 8. Are there financing options specifically for Montana cooperatives?

While there are no cooperative-exclusive loan programs, several resources are particularly supportive:
- **Montana SSBCI Loan Participation Program** offers favorable rates through CDFIs
- **MCDC** can help identify funding sources and assist with grant applications
- **MoFi**, **Montana CDC**, and **Dakota Business Lending** provide business loans with flexible terms
