## What We Can Learn from Failures

Not every cooperative succeeds. The failures teach us as much as the successes.

### Fagor Electrodomesticos (2013)

The collapse of Mondragon's founding and largest industrial cooperative offers crucial lessons.

**What Happened:**
- Founded in 1956 as Mondragon's first cooperative
- Grew to nearly 11,000 employees with factories in Spain, France, Morocco, China, Poland, and Italy
- Home appliance demand collapsed in 2008 financial crisis
- Declared bankruptcy in November 2013

**Key Lessons:**

**1. Very Large Cooperatives Need Different Governance**
With over 3,000 worker-members, direct democratic participation in General Assemblies became unwieldy. Experts recommend assemblies of delegates for cooperatives of this scale.

**2. Decision-Making Speed Matters in Crisis**
The consultative process that strengthens cooperatives in normal times slowed critical decisions during market collapse. Consider spinning off into smaller units rather than growing ever larger.

**3. Human Resources Policies Contribute to Culture**
Researchers found chronic nepotism in hiring, failures in training policy, and "reverse dominance hierarchies" that increased disengagement. Worker absenteeism rose from 4% in the 1990s to 8% before collapse.

**4. Cooperative Values Must Be Actively Transmitted**
Younger workers, hired through family connections, assumed job security was guaranteed and struggled to understand cooperative culture and mutual responsibility.

**What Mondragon Did Right:**
- Other cooperatives absorbed the majority of displaced Fagor workers through the intercooperation principle
- The federation structure prevented total abandonment of workers

> Fagor's failure shows cooperatives are not immune to market forces, but Mondragon's response shows how federation structures protect workers even when individual cooperatives fail.

---

### General Patterns in Cooperative Failures

Research across multiple countries reveals common patterns:

**Size Challenges:**
- Democratic participation works best in groups of 200-250 or smaller
- Very large cooperatives require representative governance (delegate assemblies, not direct democracy on all decisions)

**Formation Timing:**
- Cooperatives formed in crisis (to save failing businesses) have mixed results
- Conversions work best when the underlying business is healthy

**External Pressures:**
- Economic recessions stress all businesses, cooperatives included
- Global competition requires efficiency measures that can strain cooperative values

**What Helps Cooperatives Survive:**
- Federation membership and mutual support networks
- Adequate capitalization at founding
- Ongoing investment in member education
- Clear governance structures that scale with size
- Professional management accountable to democratic oversight

---

## Key Success Factors Across All Cases

Looking across these case studies, successful worker cooperatives share common elements:

### Governance That Scales
- Representative structures for larger organizations
- Professional management for daily operations
- Democratic oversight for major decisions
- Clear separation between governance and management

### Strong Financial Foundations

- Retained earnings policies for reinvestment
- Access to cooperative-friendly financing
- Individual capital accounts that align worker and business interests

### Ongoing Investment in People
- Member education on business and governance
- Clear pathways to ownership
- Competitive compensation with profit-sharing
- Training and development opportunities

### Connection to Broader Networks
- Federation membership (Arizmendi, Mondragon)
- Support from cooperative development organizations (Project Equity, Democracy at Work Institute)
- Industry-specific networks and shared resources
- Regional cooperative ecosystems (Emilia-Romagna, Industrial Commons)

### Mission Alignment
- Workers attracted by values, not just jobs
- Services or products that reflect cooperative principles
- Community connections and local investment
- Long-term thinking over short-term extraction
