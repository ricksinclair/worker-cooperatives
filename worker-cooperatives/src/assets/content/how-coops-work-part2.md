## Governance Models: Who Makes Decisions?

Worker cooperatives use democratic governance, but "democracy" takes different forms depending on the cooperative's size and culture. [^5]

### Direct Democracy (Collective Model)

Best for: Small cooperatives (typically under 30 members)

- **All members participate** in all significant decisions
- **No board of directors** or management hierarchy
- **Consensus-based** decision-making (everyone agrees, or at least consents)
- **Rotating roles** rather than fixed positions

**How it works in practice:** At a weekly or monthly meeting, members discuss issues together and reach agreement before moving forward. Everyone has equal voice and equal power.

**Example:** Suma Wholefoods (UK) uses a flat pay structure where all workers earn the same hourly rate and rotate through both desirable and undesirable tasks. [^6]

### Representative Democracy (Board Model)

Best for: Larger cooperatives (30+ members)

- **General Assembly** of all members meets annually or semi-annually
- **Elected Board/Governing Council** oversees strategy and hires management
- **Professional management** handles daily operations
- **Committees** focus on specific areas (finance, membership, workplace conditions)

**How it works in practice:** Day-to-day operations run like any business. The difference is that workers elect their oversight body rather than outside shareholders appointing it.

| Function | Traditional Corporation | Worker Cooperative |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Annual ownership meeting | Shareholder meeting | General Assembly |
| Oversight body | Board of Directors | Governing Council (elected by workers) |
| Daily operations | Executive management | Executive management (hired by council) |

**Example:** At Mondragon, the General Assembly of all worker-members meets once or twice per year to approve business plans, elect the Governing Council, and vote on major strategic questions. The Governing Council then hires and oversees professional managers who run day-to-day operations. [^4]

### Sociocracy/Holacracy (Hybrid Model)

Best for: Cooperatives seeking balance between participation and efficiency

- **Empowered circles or committees** make decisions within their domains
- **Representatives** link circles together
- **Consent-based** decision-making (no one objects vs. everyone agrees)
- **Distributed authority** rather than top-down or fully flat

**How it works in practice:** Different teams have real authority over their work areas. A representative governance circle functions like a board, but power is more distributed throughout the organization.

### Choosing Your Model

There is no single "right" governance structure. The key is matching your structure to your size, industry, and culture:

- Starting small and value deep participation? Consider direct democracy
- Growing beyond 30 members? Representative structures become practical
- Want distributed authority without pure consensus? Explore sociocracy

## Decision-Making: What Gets Voted On and How

### Types of Decisions

Not everything requires a vote. Mature cooperatives distinguish between:

**Member Vote Required (General Assembly)**
- Electing the Governing Council/Board
- Approving annual business plans and budgets
- Major capital investments or acquisitions
- Changing bylaws or governance structure
- Admitting new members (in some cooperatives)
- Mergers or dissolution

**Board/Council Decides**
- Hiring and overseeing the General Manager
- Setting strategic direction within approved plans
- Major policy decisions
- Significant contracts

**Management Decides**
- Daily operations
- Hiring non-member employees
- Routine purchasing
- Scheduling and workflow

**Individual/Team Decides**
- Task execution
- Minor process improvements
- Team coordination

### Voting Methods

**One Member, One Vote**
The foundational principle. Regardless of seniority, pay rate, or hours worked, every worker-owner has exactly one vote. [^1]

**Majority Vote**
Most common for routine decisions. 50% + 1 carries the motion.

**Supermajority (2/3 or 3/4)**
Often required for major decisions like bylaw changes, mergers, or dissolution.

**Consensus/Consent**
Used in collective-model cooperatives. Everyone must agree (consensus) or at least not block (consent) before proceeding.

### The Mondragon Model: Layered Governance

Mondragon's structure shows how larger cooperatives balance democracy with efficiency: [^4]

1. **General Assembly** (all worker-members): Elects council, approves plans, decides major issues
2. **Governing Council** (7-12 elected members): Sets policy, hires/oversees management
3. **General Manager** (professional hire): Runs operations, reports to council
4. **Social Council** (separate elected body): Focuses on working conditions, compensation, safety
5. **Watchdog Council** (audit committee): Monitors financial integrity

This creates circular accountability: workers elect the council, the council hires managers, managers supervise workers.

## Compensation Structures: How Workers Get Paid

Worker cooperatives offer multiple compensation streams: [^7]

### 1. Base Wages

Most cooperatives pay competitive market-rate wages - you do not sacrifice income for ownership. The average wage at U.S. worker cooperatives is $19.67 per hour, more than twice the federal minimum wage. [^8]

### 2. Patronage Dividends (Profit Sharing)

At year's end, after the cooperative pays all expenses, the surplus is distributed based on **patronage** - how much you contributed to the cooperative.

**The Standard Formula:**
```
Your Dividend = Total Surplus x (Your Hours / Total Hours Worked by All Owners)
```

**Example:** If the cooperative has $100,000 in surplus and you worked 10% of all worker-owner hours that year, you receive $10,000 in patronage dividends. [^7]

Some cooperatives adjust this formula to include:
- Years of membership (rewarding tenure)
- Role-based factors
- Retroactive founder compensation

### 3. Distribution of Dividends

The law requires at least 20% of your patronage dividend be paid in cash so you can cover taxes. [^7] The remainder can be:
- Paid as additional cash
- Credited to your internal capital account
- Some combination

### 4. Surplus Allocation (Before Dividends)

Before individual dividends are calculated, the cooperative typically allocates surplus: [^4]

| Allocation | Typical Range | Purpose |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| Community/Education Fund | ~10% | Local investment, training |
| Collective Reserves | ~20-45% | Retained earnings for stability |
| Individual Capital Accounts | ~45-70% | Member equity accumulation |

### 5. Pay Equity

Worker cooperatives maintain dramatically more equitable pay than traditional corporations: [^8]

| Metric | Worker Cooperatives | Traditional Corporations |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Average pay ratio | 2:1 | 351:1 |
| Mondragon cap | 1:6 to 1:9 | No cap |

Some cooperatives like Union Cab Cooperative in Madison, WI set explicit policies: the highest-paid worker cannot earn more than four times the lowest-paid worker. [^1]

## Membership Pathways: From New Hire to Worker-Owner

### The Typical Journey

**Step 1: Hired as Employee**
You start as a regular employee, not yet a member. You receive wages and benefits but do not vote or share in surplus.

**Step 2: Probationary/Candidacy Period**
Most cooperatives require a waiting period before membership eligibility:

| Duration | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **3-6 months** | Common minimum |
| **6-7 months** | Unicorn Grocery (UK) |
| **12 months** | Namaste Solar |

During this period, both you and the cooperative assess whether worker-ownership is a good fit. [^9]

**Step 3: Membership Candidacy**
At Namaste Solar, each candidate: [^10]
- Is assigned a mentor
- Follows a "candidate curriculum"
- Attends orientations about different company areas
- Completes a checklist of learning activities

**Step 4: Membership Vote**
Some cooperatives automatically offer membership after the probationary period. Others require a vote of current members. [^9]

**Step 5: Buy-In**
Pay your membership fee (often through payroll deduction) and you become a full worker-owner with:
- Voting rights
- Eligibility to run for elected positions
- Share in surplus distribution
- Equity accumulation in your capital account

### When Can You Vote?

Policies vary: [^9]
- Some cooperatives let you vote while paying your buy-in
- Others require full payment before voting rights
- Some allow participation in meetings but not formal votes during candidacy

### Leaving the Cooperative

When you leave (voluntarily or through retirement):
- Your initial buy-in is returned
- Your accumulated capital account balance is paid out
- Payout may be immediate or over a schedule (3-10+ years in some cases) [^3]

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Worker-Owners (Members)

Every worker-owner wears multiple hats:

**As a Worker:**
- Perform your job duties
- Contribute to team goals
- Participate in workplace decisions

**As an Owner:**
- Vote on major decisions
- Elect representatives
- Share financial risk and reward
- Build equity through your capital account

**As a Governor:**
- Attend General Assembly meetings
- Serve on committees (often required or expected)
- Run for elected positions
- Hold leadership accountable

### Non-Member Employees

Many cooperatives employ both worker-owners and non-owner employees. [^1] Non-members:
- Receive wages and benefits
- Do not vote or share in surplus
- May be working toward membership (in probationary period)
- May be in roles the cooperative chooses not to include in membership

### Elected Positions

**Governing Council/Board Members**
- Elected by General Assembly
- Serve fixed terms (often 2-4 years)
- Meet regularly (monthly is common)
- Set policy and oversee management

**Social Council Members** (Mondragon model)
- Focus on workplace conditions
- Advise on compensation, safety, benefits
- Provide a channel for worker concerns

**Committee Members**
- Finance, membership, marketing, etc.
- May be elected or volunteer-based
- Do focused work between full membership meetings

### Hired Management

The General Manager/CEO is typically: [^4]
- Hired by the Governing Council (not elected by members)
- A professional with business expertise
- Responsible for daily operations
- Accountable to the elected council

**Should the CEO be a member?** Cooperatives differ: [^9]
- Most allow it for engagement and loyalty
- Some exclude it to avoid concentrating power
- In some industries (home care, cleaning), managers serve a fundamentally different function

## Day-to-Day Operations: How Work Actually Happens

### The Short Answer

Daily work in a cooperative looks remarkably similar to daily work anywhere else. People show up, do their jobs, coordinate with colleagues, and go home.

The difference is in *who decides* how that work is structured and *who benefits* from its success.

### What Changes

**Transparency:** Financial information is typically shared with all members. You know how the business is doing.

**Voice:** You can raise concerns through formal channels (Social Council, committees) or informal ones (direct conversations with elected leaders who are also your coworkers).

**Accountability:** Managers answer to workers, not distant shareholders. If leadership is not working, members can vote them out.

**Participation:** You are expected to engage beyond your job duties - attending meetings, serving on committees, staying informed about business decisions.

### What Stays the Same

- Schedules and deadlines
- Job-specific skills and responsibilities
- Coordination with teammates
- Customer or client service
- Quality standards

**Common misconception:** "Don't cooperatives vote on everything?"

No. Time-sensitive operational decisions do not wait for votes any more than they would wait for a corporate board meeting. Professional managers have authority to act. Workers vote on strategic direction and elect oversight - they do not design supply chains or approve every purchase order. [^4]

## Key Takeaways

1. **Ownership is equal and personal.** One member, one share, one vote. Your equity grows through internal capital accounts.

2. **Governance scales with size.** Small cooperatives use direct democracy; larger ones use representative structures. Both work.

3. **Daily operations run like any business.** Workers vote on strategy, not supply chains. Professional management handles execution.

4. **Compensation includes wages plus more.** Competitive pay, patronage dividends, and equity accumulation.

5. **Membership is earned, not automatic.** Probationary periods let both sides evaluate fit before commitment.

6. **Everyone wears multiple hats.** Worker, owner, governor. Engagement beyond your job is expected.
