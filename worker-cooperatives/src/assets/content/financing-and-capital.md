# Financing and Capital for Worker Cooperatives

A practical guide to funding cooperative enterprises—from startup to growth and beyond.

---

## Why Traditional Financing Can Be Challenging

Worker cooperatives face unique hurdles when seeking capital. Understanding these challenges is the first step to overcoming them.

### The Structural Mismatch

Traditional financing infrastructure was built around investor-owned businesses. This creates friction for cooperatives in several ways:

- **Personal guarantee requirements**: SBA loans require guarantees from owners with 20%+ stakes—but cooperative members rarely hold stakes that large
- **Equity expectations**: Venture capital and private equity expect governance rights and exit strategies incompatible with democratic ownership
- **Unfamiliar structure**: Many lenders don't understand cooperative governance, leading to declined applications or unfavorable terms
- **Collateral gaps**: Worker cooperatives often lack the traditional collateral banks require

### It's Not Insurmountable

Despite these challenges, cooperatives successfully raise capital every day. The key is knowing where to look and how to structure your ask.

As the source document notes: "The real issue isn't that cooperatives *can't* raise capital—it's that the existing financial infrastructure is built around traditional equity. This is a path-dependency problem, not an inherent limitation."

The good news: a robust ecosystem of cooperative-friendly lenders, CDFIs, and creative financing tools has emerged to fill this gap.

## Internal Capital Sources

The strongest cooperatives build equity from within. These sources form your financial foundation.

### Member Equity (Buy-In Capital)

Every cooperative member contributes an initial capital investment—often called a membership fee or buy-in.

**How it works:**
- Each co-op sets its own buy-in amount based on capital needs and members' ability to pay
- Buy-ins become personal property of the member, redeemable when they leave
- Pre-incorporation expenses paid by founders can count toward their membership shares

**Best practices:**
- Balance capital needs with accessibility—high buy-ins can exclude lower-income workers
- Consider payment plans to make membership achievable
- Document all pre-incorporation contributions carefully

### Retained Earnings

Keeping a portion of annual surplus in the business builds long-term stability.

**Typical allocation (Mondragon model):**
- 10% to community/educational funds
- 20-45% to collective reserves (retained earnings)
- 45-70% credited to individual capital accounts

Retained earnings provide patient capital that doesn't require external approval or repayment. They're the engine of sustainable growth.

### Internal Capital Accounts

A distinctive cooperative innovation that aligns member interests with long-term business health.

**How they work:**
- Each worker-member has an individual capital account
- A portion of annual surplus is credited to their account
- Accounts earn interest over time
- Balances are paid out when the member leaves or retires

**Why they matter:**
- Address the "horizon problem" (retiring workers preferring short-term payouts)
- Create personal stake in business success
- Provide clear, fair system for distributing value

## External Capital Sources

When internal resources aren't enough, these instruments let cooperatives raise outside capital while preserving democratic control.

### Non-Voting Preferred Shares

Equity-like returns without governance rights.

**Structure:**
- Investors receive dividend payments (often a fixed percentage)
- No voting rights on cooperative governance
- May include redemption provisions after a set period

**Best for:** Mission-aligned investors who want financial returns but respect cooperative autonomy.

Since 2012, Colorado's Limited Cooperative Association statute has made it easier to create investor classes alongside member-owners, and other states are following suit.

### Debt Instruments

Traditional loans and bonds that provide capital without diluting ownership.

**Options include:**
- Term loans from cooperative-friendly lenders
- Lines of credit for working capital
- Member loans (loans from members beyond their equity stake)
- Community investment notes

**Key advantage:** Lenders have no governance rights—you repay principal plus interest, maintaining full democratic control.

### Revenue-Based Financing (Non-Extractive Capital)

A cooperative-aligned alternative gaining momentum.

**How it works:**
- Repayments are calculated as a percentage of monthly revenue or profits
- If there's no profit in a given month, no payment is due
- Returns are tied to project success, minimizing risk for both parties

**Pioneered by:** [Seed Commons](https://seedcommons.org/) and [The Working World](https://www.theworkingworld.org/us/), which call this "non-extractive finance"—capital structured so borrowers "will never be worse off after working with us than before working with us."

**Best for:** Startups and conversions with uncertain cash flow projections.

## Government Programs

Federal and state programs can provide favorable terms—though cooperatives often need to navigate requirements designed for traditional businesses.

### SBA Loans

**Current status (2025):**
- SBA now allows lenders to use delegated authority for cooperative loans
- 7(a) and 504 programs are technically available to cooperatives

**The challenge:**
SBA requires personal guarantees from owners with 20%+ stakes. Since cooperative members rarely hold stakes that large, this effectively bars many co-ops from the program despite being listed as eligible entities.

**Workaround:** Work with SBA Preferred Lenders experienced with cooperatives, like National Cooperative Bank.

## Conversion Financing

When existing businesses transition to worker ownership, specialized financing bridges the gap.

### Why Conversions Need Special Attention

- Selling owners need payment for their equity
- Workers typically lack capital to buy outright
- Traditional lenders may not understand the transaction
- Working capital needs continue during transition

### Key Resources for Conversions

**Project Equity** offers financing through:
- Accelerate Employee Ownership
- Employee Ownership Catalyst Fund

These provide flexible capital rarely available through traditional means.

**Shared Capital Cooperative** has financed numerous conversions:
- Nick's Pizza conversion: $350,000
- Winterbloom Landscaping conversion: $80,000

**Minnesota Shared Ownership Loan Fund**
- Created by MCCD and Minnesota DEED
- Flexible, low-interest capital for conversion financing
- Focus on businesses 51%+ owned by underrepresented groups

### Seller Financing

Many successful conversions include seller notes where the departing owner receives payment over time. This:
- Reduces upfront capital requirements
- Demonstrates owner confidence in the business
- Aligns seller interests with successful transition
