# What Is a Worker Cooperative?

## The Basics: Workers Own, Workers Decide, Workers Thrive

A **worker cooperative** is a business owned and democratically governed by its employees. Rather than outside shareholders or a single proprietor holding equity and making decisions, the people who do the work collectively own the enterprise and share in its profits, losses, and governance.

In a worker cooperative:

- **You own where you work** - Employees hold equity stakes, not outside shareholders
- **One person, one vote** - Democratic governance means everyone has an equal say, regardless of investment amount
- **Profits stay with workers** - Surplus gets distributed to those who created it
- **Shared risk and reward** - Workers collectively benefit from success and navigate challenges together

This is not a utopian experiment. Worker cooperatives operate in virtually every industry you can imagine: manufacturing, technology, healthcare, retail, construction, professional services, restaurants, and more. From bakeries in the Bay Area to billion-dollar manufacturing federations in Spain, this model has proven itself across the globe. [^1]

## The 7 Cooperative Principles

Cooperatives around the world operate according to the same core principles, formally adopted by the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) in 1995. These principles trace back to the Rochdale Pioneers, who founded the first modern cooperative in England in 1844. [^2]

### 1. Voluntary and Open Membership
Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political, or religious discrimination.

### 2. Democratic Member Control
Cooperatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members. In worker cooperatives, this means **one member, one vote**—regardless of how much you've invested or how long you've been there.

### 3. Member Economic Participation
Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their cooperative. Surpluses are allocated to developing the cooperative, benefiting members in proportion to their contributions, and supporting other member-approved activities.

### 4. Autonomy and Independence
Cooperatives are self-help organizations controlled by their members. If they enter into agreements with other organizations or raise external capital, they do so on terms that maintain democratic member control.

### 5. Education, Training, and Information
Cooperatives provide education and training for members, elected representatives, managers, and employees so they can contribute effectively. Many, like Mondragon, operate their own universities and ongoing training programs. [^3]

### 6. Cooperation Among Cooperatives
Cooperatives serve their members most effectively by working together through local, national, regional, and international structures. This is why cooperative federations and networks exist worldwide.

### 7. Concern for Community
Cooperatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members. A portion of surplus often goes directly to community and educational programs.

Some cooperatives are now considering an **eighth principle** focused on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, striving to incorporate these values at all levels of their organizations. [^2]

## A Brief History of the Cooperative Movement

The cooperative movement has deep roots, shaped by workers responding to exploitation and economic hardship.

### The Vision: Robert Owen (1771-1858)
Robert Owen, a Welsh labor activist and successful textile manufacturer, is broadly regarded as the father of the cooperative movement. Motivated by the struggles of laborers, he envisioned self-sufficient, self-governing communities where workers would have access to education and shared resources. While his specific experiments failed, his ideas laid the groundwork for what came next. [^4]

### The Blueprint: William King and The Cooperator
In the 1830s, William King urged a more practical implementation of cooperatives through his magazine *The Cooperator*, focusing on tangible solutions to poverty and economic grievances. This gave way to the formation of the Rochdale Pioneers.

### The Founding: Rochdale Pioneers (1844)
In Rochdale, England, poor living conditions, low wages, and failed strikes led twenty-eight weavers to pool their resources. On **December 21, 1844**, with just 28 pounds they had collectively saved, they opened a small store on Toad Lane selling butter, flour, sugar, oatmeal, and candles. [^4]

Their innovation was not the store itself, but the principles behind it: democratic governance, open membership, and equitable distribution of surplus. These became known as the **Rochdale Principles**—the foundation of the modern cooperative movement.

### Growth and Global Spread
- **1845**: By year's end, the Pioneers had 80 members and 182 pounds in capital
- **1883**: The Women's Co-op Guild formed, advocating for workers and female suffrage
- **1900**: The British cooperative movement had grown to 1,439 cooperatives
- **1956**: Mondragon Corporation founded in Spain's Basque Country
- **Today**: Over 3 million cooperatives exist worldwide, with over 1 billion members, employing 280 million people [^4]

## How Worker Cooperatives Differ from Other Business Structures

Understanding what makes worker cooperatives unique requires comparing them to other common structures.

### Worker Cooperative vs. Traditional Corporation

| Feature | Worker Cooperative | Traditional Corporation |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Ownership** | Workers own the business | Shareholders (often external investors) own the business |
| **Voting rights** | One member, one vote | One share, one vote (more shares = more power) |
| **Profit distribution** | Distributed to workers based on contribution | Distributed to shareholders as dividends |
| **Governance** | Democratic; workers elect leadership | Board elected by shareholders; workers have no formal voice |
| **Pay ratios** | Average 2:1 (highest to lowest paid) | Average 351:1 at typical corporations [^1] |
| **Primary obligation** | Workers and community | Shareholders and profit maximization |

### Worker Cooperative vs. ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan)

ESOPs are another form of employee ownership, but they differ significantly from worker cooperatives. [^5]

| Feature | Worker Cooperative | ESOP |
|---------|-------------------|------|
| **Ownership structure** | Each worker holds one equal share | A trust holds shares for employees; ownership is often proportional to salary |
| **Voting rights** | One worker, one vote on all major decisions | Limited voting rights; larger shareholders (higher salaries) often have more power |
| **Democratic control** | Required; workers elect governing body | Not required; traditional management structure can remain |
| **Tax treatment** | Taxed on undistributed earnings; distributed patronage is taxed at member level | Significant tax advantages; ESOPs can be tax-exempt |
| **Cultural focus** | Democratic participation and shared governance | Often primarily a retirement benefit |

**Key insight**: ESOPs offer significant tax benefits and can work well for larger companies, but they do not guarantee democratic worker control. If democratic governance is your priority, a worker cooperative is the clearer choice. [^5]

### Worker Cooperative vs. Partnership

| Feature | Worker Cooperative | Partnership |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Entry barrier** | Open membership; new workers can become members | Partners must be invited/approved by existing partners |
| **Liability** | Limited liability (in most structures) | Partners often have unlimited personal liability |
| **Scalability** | Can grow to thousands of worker-owners | Typically limited to a smaller number of partners |
| **Democratic principle** | One person, one vote | Often weighted by capital contribution or partnership tier |

## Types of Worker Cooperatives

Worker cooperatives come in many forms, varying by industry, size, and structure.

### By Industry Sector

Worker cooperatives operate successfully across virtually every industry: [^6]

**Service Sector**
- Housecleaning and janitorial services
- Restaurants and cafes
- Childcare centers
- Transportation (taxi cooperatives)
- Day labor centers

**Retail**
- Grocery stores and food cooperatives
- Bakeries (like the Arizmendi network)

The global tech worker cooperative movement, while still small, includes over 80 tech worker cooperatives united through networks like Patio, connecting approximately 1,500 cooperators across more than 24 countries. [^6]

### By Size

Worker cooperatives range dramatically in scale:

**Micro-cooperatives (2-10 workers)**
- Most common in the U.S.
- Often service-based or skilled trades
- Highly participatory with direct democracy

**Small cooperatives (10-50 workers)**
- The majority of U.S. worker cooperatives fall here
- Common in retail, professional services, and manufacturing
- Typically use representative governance structures

**Medium cooperatives (50-500 workers)**
- Less common but well-established examples exist
- Usually have formal governance structures with elected councils
- Often operate in healthcare, manufacturing, or multi-location retail

**Large cooperatives (500+ workers)**
- Rare but powerful demonstrations of scalability
- Examples include CHCA (2,000+ workers), John Lewis Partnership (80,000+ partners), and Mondragon (80,000+ workers across 80+ cooperatives)
- Require sophisticated governance with representative democracy, professional management, and federation structures

## Common Misconceptions About Worker Cooperatives

### Misconception 1: "Workers prefer stable wages to ownership"

**Reality**: Cooperatives routinely offer base wages at or above market rates, with profit-sharing as an additional component. Workers get both stability and ownership. During downturns, cooperatives often reduce hours across the board rather than laying off workers, distributing hardship more equitably. [^3]

### Misconception 2: "Cooperatives can't raise capital"

**Reality**: Cooperatives raise external capital through non-voting debt, preferred shares, retained earnings, cooperative banks, and government programs. Mondragon operates its own bank (Laboral Kutxa) specifically to finance cooperative development. The challenge is that existing financial infrastructure is built around traditional equity—a path-dependency problem, not an inherent limitation. [^3]

### Misconception 3: "Democratic decision-making is too slow"

**Reality**: Mature cooperatives use representative governance similar to conventional corporations. Workers elect governing councils who oversee professional managers with full authority over daily operations. Major strategic decisions go to vote once or twice per year. The difference is *who votes*, not *how often*. [^3]

### Misconception 4: "Cooperatives don't scale"

**Reality**: Mondragon employs over 80,000 people across more than 80 cooperatives. Emilia-Romagna's cooperatives account for roughly 30% of regional GDP. John Lewis Partnership operates one of the UK's largest retail chains with 80,000+ employee-partners. Cooperatives can and do scale. [^1]

### Misconception 5: "Workers lack business expertise"

**Reality**: Cooperatives hire professional management and rely on elected councils for oversight—just like conventional corporations rely on boards. Workers vote on broad direction and elect representatives; they don't design supply chains or negotiate contracts. Many cooperatives invest heavily in member education and training. [^3]

### Misconception 6: "Free-rider and short-term thinking are inevitable"

**Reality**: Cooperatives address these through vesting periods, internal capital accounts, retained earnings policies, and long-term planning oversight by elected councils. Mondragon's internal capital account system specifically addresses the horizon problem by crediting surplus to individual accounts that aren't withdrawn until departure or retirement. [^3]

## Why Choose a Worker Cooperative?

### For You as a Worker

- **Better pay with profit-sharing on top**: Average wage at U.S. worker co-ops is $19.67/hour—more than twice the federal minimum wage [^1]
- **Real equity and wealth-building**: Ownership means you build value over time, not just collect wages
- **Job security**: Worker cooperatives survive their first 6-10 years at a rate 7% higher than traditional small businesses [^1]
- **Voice and dignity**: You have a real say in how the business operates, what it prioritizes, and where it's headed
- **Equitable pay**: Pay ratios average 2:1 compared to 351:1 at typical corporations [^1]

### For Your Community

- **Money stays local**: Profits go to workers who live in and spend money within the community
- **Stable employment**: Cooperatives prioritize job retention over layoffs
- **Community investment**: Many cooperatives dedicate a portion of surplus to education and community programs
- **Economic resilience**: Communities with more cooperatives show greater economic stability

### For the Economy

- **Proven resilience**: In France, cooperatives' three-year survival rate is 80-90% versus 66% for all businesses [^1]

## Success Stories: It Works in the Real World

### Mondragon Corporation (Spain)
Founded in 1956 by a small group of workers in the Basque Country, Mondragon has grown into the world's largest federation of worker cooperatives. Operating across finance, manufacturing, retail, and education with 80,000+ workers and 11+ billion euros in annual revenue, it proves democratic ownership can compete globally. [^3]

### Cooperative Home Care Associates (Bronx, NY)
The largest worker cooperative in the United States, with over 2,000 worker-owners providing home healthcare. CHCA demonstrates that the cooperative model can transform low-wage service work into quality jobs with dignity and pathways to ownership. [^1]

### John Lewis Partnership (United Kingdom)
One of the UK's largest retailers with 80,000+ employee-partners. Employees own the company, share profits through annual bonuses, and participate in governance through elected councils. Decades of profitable operation demonstrate cooperative viability at scale in retail. [^1]

### Arizmendi Bakeries (San Francisco Bay Area)
A network of worker-owned bakeries inspired by Mondragon's principles. Each location is independently owned by its workers while sharing recipes, branding, and practices—demonstrating how cooperatives can replicate through federation. [^1]

## The Bottom Line

Worker cooperatives are not a fantasy or a compromise. They are businesses that compete successfully in real markets while putting workers first. They create better jobs, build community wealth, and prove that democratic ownership works at scale.

The question is not whether worker cooperatives can work—seven decades of Mondragon's operation and thousands of cooperatives worldwide have answered that. The question is: will you be part of building an economy where workers have real ownership, voice, and power?
