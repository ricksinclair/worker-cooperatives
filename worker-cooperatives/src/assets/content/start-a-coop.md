# How to Start a Worker Cooperative

## A Step-by-Step Guide for Founders

Starting a worker cooperative is one of the most meaningful ways to build a business. You're not just creating jobs—you're creating ownership, voice, and shared prosperity for everyone involved. This guide walks you through the entire process, from your first conversations to opening day and beyond.

## Is a Worker Cooperative Right for You?

Before diving into formation, take an honest look at whether this model fits your vision, your team, and your industry. Worker cooperatives thrive when founders share certain values and circumstances.

### Ask Yourself These Questions

**About Your Vision:**
- Do you believe the people who do the work should own and control the business?
- Are you comfortable sharing decision-making power equally with your co-founders and future members?
- Is building long-term community wealth more important to you than personal wealth accumulation?
- Can you commit to the additional time and effort democratic governance requires?

**About Your Team:**
- Do you have a core group of people who share your vision and values?
- Are these people willing to invest significant time (and potentially money) in the formation process?
- Does your group have complementary skills that cover the business's core needs?
- Can you navigate disagreements productively and make decisions together?

**About Your Business Idea:**
- Is your business idea viable as a traditional business first? (Cooperative structure doesn't save a bad business model.)
- Will the business generate enough revenue to support multiple worker-owners?
- Does your industry lend itself to collaborative work and shared ownership?
- Are there examples of successful cooperatives in your sector?

**Red Flags to Consider:**
- One person wants to maintain control or make final decisions
- Team members have fundamentally different goals for the business
- The business model only works with minimum-wage labor
- You're choosing cooperative structure primarily for tax benefits rather than values alignment

If you're answering "yes" to most of the vision and team questions, a worker cooperative could be an excellent fit. If you're uncertain, consider attending a [USFWC startup webinar](https://www.usworker.coop/clinic/startups/) or connecting with existing cooperatives in your field.

## The Founding Team

### Who You Need

Every successful cooperative starts with a committed core group. You don't need dozens of people—but you do need the right people.

**Minimum Size:**
- Most experts recommend **5-15 founding members** for a startup cooperative
- Smaller groups (3-5) can work but may struggle with workload distribution and capital
- Larger groups face coordination challenges during formation

**Essential Roles to Cover:**
- **Business operations**: Someone who understands (or can learn) the nuts and bolts of running your type of business
- **Financial management**: Basic bookkeeping, budgeting, and financial planning skills
- **Industry expertise**: Deep knowledge of your product or service
- **Facilitation and communication**: Someone who can run meetings, navigate disagreements, and keep the group moving forward
- **Administrative capacity**: Willingness to handle paperwork, filings, and documentation

You don't need one person per role—skills often overlap. And you can hire or contract for expertise you lack. But your core group should be able to collectively move the formation process forward.

### Building Shared Vision

Before you write a single bylaw, spend time building genuine alignment:

- **Articulate your values**: Why are you doing this? What kind of workplace do you want to create?
- **Define success**: What does success look like in one year? Five years? Ten years?
- **Discuss expectations**: How much time and money can each person contribute? What roles interest people?
- **Address potential conflicts early**: What happens if someone wants to leave? How will you handle disagreements?

Many cooperatives use written **vision statements** and **founding member agreements** to document this alignment before moving into formal incorporation.

## Step-by-Step Formation Process

The formation process typically takes **12-18 months** from first meeting to launch, though simpler businesses may move faster and complex ones may take longer. Here's what to expect at each stage.

### Step 1: Feasibility Study
**Timeline: 1-3 months**

Before investing serious time and money, confirm your business idea is viable.

**Market Research:**
- Who are your customers? What problem do you solve for them?
- Who are your competitors? What's your competitive advantage?
- What's the market size? Is it growing or shrinking?
- What are realistic revenue projections?

**Financial Feasibility:**
- What are startup costs (equipment, space, inventory, licensing)?
- What are ongoing operating costs?
- When will you break even? Can you survive until then?
- How much capital do you need to launch?

**Cooperative Feasibility:**
- Can the business support multiple worker-owners at fair wages?
- Are there similar cooperatives you can learn from?
- What cooperative development resources exist in your area?

**Resources:**
- [Democracy at Work Institute's Startup Resources](https://institute.coop/startup)
- [California Center for Cooperative Development's Steps Guide](https://cccd.coop/steps-starting-worker-co-op)
- Your local Small Business Development Center (SBDC) for general business feasibility support

**Milestone:** A written feasibility assessment your core group has reviewed and agreed provides sufficient foundation to proceed.

---

### Step 2: Business Planning
**Timeline: 2-4 months**

A worker cooperative needs a solid business plan just like any other business. Don't skip this step.

**Your Business Plan Should Include:**
- Executive summary
- Company description and mission
- Market analysis
- Products/services description
- Marketing and sales strategy
- Operations plan
- Management structure
- Financial projections (3-5 years)

**Cooperative-Specific Elements:**
- Membership structure and requirements
- Governance overview
- Profit-sharing approach
- Member capital contributions

**Key Principle:** Your business plan needs to work as a *business* first. Cooperative structure enhances a viable business—it doesn't rescue a failing one.

**Resources:**
- [SCORE](https://www.score.org/) offers free business mentoring
- Local SBDCs provide business planning assistance
- [The L.A. Co-op Lab's course](https://academy.lacooplab.com/course/coophowto) guides you through seven key areas of cooperative business development

**Milestone:** A complete business plan that demonstrates financial viability and has buy-in from all founding members.

---

### Step 3: Choosing Your Legal Structure
**Timeline: 2-4 weeks (research and decision)**

You have two main options for legally structuring your worker cooperative:

#### Option A: Cooperative Corporation

**Best for:**
- Groups wanting formal recognition as a cooperative
- States with well-developed cooperative corporation statutes
- Cooperatives planning to use Subchapter T tax treatment
- Larger groups expecting significant membership changes over time

**Advantages:**
- Clear legal framework designed for cooperatives
- Easier to qualify for Subchapter T tax benefits
- Can use "cooperative" in your legal name (in most states)
- Well-established law around member equity and patronage

**Considerations:**
- More rigid governance requirements
- Workers are employees (W-2), subject to employment law
- State-specific statutes vary significantly

#### Option B: Limited Liability Company (LLC)

**Best for:**
- Groups wanting maximum flexibility in governance design
- States without good cooperative corporation statutes
- Smaller cooperatives with stable membership
- Undocumented workers (who can be LLC members but not traditional employees)

**Advantages:**
- Highly flexible—Operating Agreement can be customized extensively
- Members can be owners without being employees (avoiding W-2 requirements)
- Simpler in some respects
- Pass-through taxation by default

**Considerations:**
- May not qualify for Subchapter T tax treatment
- Can't use "cooperative" in legal name in some states
- More complex when members join and leave frequently
- Must build cooperative protections into Operating Agreement (not automatic)

**Expert Advice:** The [Sustainable Economies Law Center](https://www.theselc.org/llc_v_cooperative_corporation) recommends the cooperative corporation as the best entity for most worker cooperatives—unless members are undocumented.

**Resources:**
- [Sustainable Economies Law Center: LLC vs. Cooperative Corporation](https://www.theselc.org/llc_v_cooperative_corporation)
- [Democracy at Work Institute: Choice of Entity Guide](https://institute.coop/sites/default/files/ChoicofEntityFinal.pdf)
- Consult a cooperative-friendly attorney in your state

**Milestone:** A clear decision on legal structure, documented and agreed upon by founding members, ideally with input from a cooperative-familiar attorney.

---

### Step 4: Drafting Governance Documents
**Timeline: 1-3 months**

Your governance documents are the constitution of your cooperative. They define how decisions get made, how profits are shared, and how members join and leave.

#### For Cooperative Corporations: Bylaws

Your bylaws should address:

**Membership:**
- Eligibility requirements (who can become a member?)
- Application and approval process
- Probationary/trial period (commonly 3-6 months)
- Member capital contribution (buy-in amount)
- Rights and responsibilities of members
- Resignation, removal, and buyout procedures

**Governance:**
- General membership meetings (frequency, quorum, notice requirements)
- Board of directors (size, terms, election process, powers)
- Officer positions and duties
- Committees (if any)
- Voting procedures (one member, one vote)
- Amendment process

**Economics:**
- Fiscal year
- Capital account structure
- Patronage allocation formula
- Profit distribution timing
- Reserve requirements
- Member equity redemption

#### For LLCs: Operating Agreement

An LLC Operating Agreement must explicitly build in cooperative principles since they're not automatic. Cover all the same topics as bylaws, plus:
- Clear statement of cooperative principles
- Voting rights tied to membership, not capital investment
- Profit distribution based on labor contribution (patronage)
- Protections against non-cooperative amendments

**Resources:**
- Template bylaws are available from [Democracy at Work Institute](https://institute.coop/resources)
- [Sustainable Economies Law Center](https://www.theselc.org/) offers California-focused templates
- Regional cooperative development organizations often provide state-specific templates

**Important:** While templates are helpful starting points, have a cooperative-knowledgeable attorney review your final documents. [USFWC's directory](https://www.usworker.coop/directory/) includes cooperative-friendly lawyers.

**Milestone:** Drafted governance documents reviewed and approved by founding members and (ideally) legal counsel.

---

### Step 5: Incorporation/Formation Filing
**Timeline: 2-4 weeks**

Once your governance documents are ready, file with your state to formally create the legal entity.

**For Cooperative Corporations:**
- File Articles of Incorporation with your state's Secretary of State (or equivalent)
- Include required cooperative-specific language
- Pay filing fees (typically $50-500 depending on state)

**For LLCs:**
- File Articles of Organization with your state
- Pay filing fees

**Additional Filings:**
- Register for state business licenses if required
- File any required initial reports or statements

**State-Specific Guidance:** Laws vary significantly by state. [Find your state-specific guide](/states) for detailed filing requirements.

**Milestone:** Receive official confirmation of incorporation from your state.

---

### Step 6: Obtaining EIN and Business Licenses
**Timeline: 1-2 weeks**

**Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN):**
- Apply online at [IRS.gov](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online)—it's free and instant
- You'll need this for tax filings, opening bank accounts, and hiring

**Business Licenses and Permits:**
Requirements vary by location and industry. Common needs include:
- General business license (city or county level)
- Industry-specific permits (food handling, contractor's license, professional certifications)
- Zoning permits
- Sales tax permit

Check with your city, county, and state for requirements specific to your business type and location.

**Milestone:** EIN obtained, all required licenses and permits identified, applications submitted.

---

### Step 7: Setting Up Banking and Accounting
**Timeline: 2-4 weeks**

**Banking:**
- Open a business checking account in the cooperative's name
- Consider a cooperative or community-oriented bank/credit union
- Set up any needed merchant services for card payments
- Establish clear procedures for who can access accounts and authorize transactions

**Accounting System:**
- Choose accounting software appropriate for your size (QuickBooks, Wave, etc.)
- Set up chart of accounts including member capital accounts
- Establish bookkeeping procedures
- Decide on cash vs. accrual accounting method

**Payroll:**
- Set up payroll system (in-house or through a payroll service)
- Understand employment tax requirements (federal, state, local)
- Create procedures for tracking hours, processing payments, and handling taxes

**Cooperative-Specific Accounting:**
- Internal capital accounts for tracking each member's equity
- Patronage tracking system (hours worked or wages earned)
- Retained earnings vs. distribution policies

**Resources:**
- [USFWC directory](https://www.usworker.coop/directory/) includes cooperative-friendly accountants
- Consider accountants experienced with Subchapter T if you're using that tax treatment

**Milestone:** Bank accounts open, accounting system operational, payroll procedures in place.

---

### Step 8: Member Recruitment and Onboarding
**Timeline: Ongoing**

If you're launching with your founding team, this step is about formalizing membership. As you grow, it becomes your ongoing recruitment process.

**Formalizing Founding Members:**
- Each founder completes membership application
- Pay (or arrange payment of) initial member capital contribution
- Sign membership agreement
- Complete any required orientation or training

**Trial/Probationary Period:**
Many cooperatives use a probationary period (3-6 months is common) before granting full membership and voting rights. During this time:
- New worker-members learn the business and cooperative culture
- Existing members assess fit
- The prospective member decides if they want to commit

**Ongoing Recruitment:**
As you grow, establish clear processes for:
- Advertising positions
- Interviewing and selection (often involving current members)
- Onboarding and training
- Probationary period evaluation
- Full membership approval

**Member Education:**
Strong cooperatives invest in ongoing member education:
- Cooperative principles and history
- Financial literacy and understanding the business
- Governance participation and meeting facilitation
- Industry and job-specific skills

**Milestone:** All founding members formally enrolled, with clear processes established for future member recruitment.

---

### Step 9: Capitalization
**Timeline: Concurrent with other steps**

Every business needs startup capital. Worker cooperatives have several sources to draw from.

#### Member Equity Contributions

Most cooperatives require members to make an initial capital contribution (buy-in) to become owners. This typically ranges from **$500 to $5,000**, though some cooperatives set amounts as low as $25 or as high as $10,000+.

**Options for member contributions:**
- Lump sum payment
- Payroll deductions over time
- "Sweat equity" (contributed labor hours)
- Combination approaches

#### Retained Earnings

Once operating, cooperatives build capital by retaining a portion of surplus rather than distributing all profits to members. This is typically codified in bylaws.

#### External Financing

**Cooperative-Friendly Lenders:**
- [Shared Capital Cooperative](https://sharedcapital.coop/borrow/worker-ownership-fund/) - Worker Ownership Loan Fund specifically for worker co-ops
- [Seed Commons](https://seedcommons.org/) - Network of community loan funds using non-extractive financing (payments as percentage of profits)
- [The Working World](https://www.theworkingworld.org/) - Non-extractive capital for worker-owned businesses
- Local Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs)

**Traditional Financing:**
- SBA loans (cooperatives are eligible)
- Bank loans
- Lines of credit

**Grants:**
- Some foundations and community organizations offer grants for cooperative development
- USDA Rural Cooperative Development Grants (for rural areas)

**Preferred Shares and Non-Voting Investor Capital:**
Cooperatives can accept investment from non-members through instruments that provide financial returns without governance rights.

**Resources:**
- [Project Equity's Financing FAQ](https://project-equity.org/financing-faqs/)
- [Seed Commons: Non-Extractive Finance](https://seedcommons.org/projects/non-extractive-finance)

**Milestone:** Sufficient startup capital secured through member contributions, loans, and/or other sources.

---

### Step 10: Launch
**Timeline: The culmination of 12-18 months of work**

You've done the hard work. Now it's time to open your doors.

**Pre-Launch Checklist:**
- [ ] Legal entity formed and in good standing

## Timeline Expectations

### Starting a New Cooperative

| Phase | Timeframe |
|-------|-----------|
| Initial exploration and team building | 1-3 months |
| Feasibility study | 1-3 months |
| Business planning | 2-4 months |
| Legal structure decision and document drafting | 2-4 months |
| Incorporation and licensing | 1-2 months |
| Banking, accounting, member formalization | 1-2 months |
| Capitalization | Concurrent |
| **Total** | **12-18 months typical** |

Simpler businesses with experienced founders may move faster. Complex businesses, industries with significant licensing requirements, or groups that need extensive consensus-building may take longer.

### Converting an Existing Business

Business conversions often take **2-4 years** for the full transition, executed in stages:
1. **Exploration** (3-6 months): Owner evaluates fit, consults advisors, discusses with employees
2. **Due diligence** (3-6 months): Business valuation, legal and financial structuring
3. **Deal negotiation** (3-12 months): Agree on price, terms, and timeline
4. **Transition** (6-24 months): Gradual transfer of ownership, governance development, member education
5. **Full ownership** (ongoing): Complete buyout, independent operation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Business Fundamentals

**Mistake: Skipping feasibility and business planning because "we're a cooperative."**
Cooperative structure doesn't save a bad business idea. You need a viable business model first.

**Mistake: Undercapitalization.**
Many cooperatives launch without sufficient capital to weather slow early months or unexpected challenges. Be realistic about startup costs and runway.

**Mistake: Underpricing products/services.**
Cooperatives sometimes underprice to be "accessible." But your prices need to support fair wages for all members. Price for sustainability.

### Governance and Process

**Mistake: Rushing incorporation before building team alignment.**
Taking time upfront to align on vision, values, and expectations prevents painful conflicts later. Don't incorporate until you have genuine buy-in on fundamentals.

**Mistake: Over-engineering governance for a small team.**
A 5-person startup doesn't need elaborate committee structures. Start simple and add complexity as you grow.

**Mistake: Under-engineering governance for growth.**
Conversely, if you're planning to scale, build structures that can accommodate more members from the start.

**Mistake: Assuming democracy means no leadership.**
Democratic workplaces still need clear roles, accountability, and sometimes hierarchy for day-to-day operations. Democracy is about *ultimate* control, not every decision.

### Legal and Financial

**Mistake: DIY-ing legal documents.**
Template bylaws are a starting point, not a finished product. Get your governance documents reviewed by an attorney who understands cooperatives in your state.

**Mistake: Ignoring tax implications.**
Subchapter T, patronage accounting, and member capital accounts have specific requirements. Work with an accountant familiar with cooperative taxation.

**Mistake: Choosing legal structure for the wrong reasons.**
Pick your structure based on fit, not convenience. The wrong structure can create significant problems later.

### Team and Culture

**Mistake: Avoiding difficult conversations.**
What happens when a member isn't performing? When someone wants to leave? When members disagree about direction? Address these questions early, even when uncomfortable.

**Mistake: Not investing in member education.**
Strong cooperatives continuously educate members about business fundamentals, cooperative principles, and governance. Budget time and resources for this.

**Mistake: Hiring for skills alone.**
In a cooperative, values alignment and ability to work collectively are as important as technical skills. Hire for both.

## Converting an Existing Business

You don't have to start from scratch. Converting an existing business to worker ownership can be faster, less risky, and better for communities.

### Why Consider Conversion?

- **Business succession**: Many business owners are approaching retirement without succession plans. Worker buyouts keep businesses local and preserve jobs.
- **Reduced risk**: The business is already operating and profitable—you're not starting from zero.
- **Existing team**: Workers already know the business and each other.
- **Community impact**: Conversion prevents closures and job losses when owners retire or exit.

### The Conversion Process

1. **Owner decides to explore**: Current owner researches employee ownership options
2. **Feasibility assessment**: Is the business healthy? Are workers interested?
3. **Valuation**: Professional appraisal establishes fair market value
4. **Deal structuring**: How will the purchase be financed? What's the timeline?
5. **Governance development**: Workers create bylaws, elect leadership, establish processes
6. **Transaction closes**: Ownership officially transfers
7. **Transition period**: Often involves phased buyout and owner involvement during handoff

### Financing a Conversion

Conversions typically combine:
- **Member equity contributions** from new worker-owners
- **Seller financing** (owner accepts payment over time)
- **External loans** from cooperative-friendly lenders
- **SBA loans** (cooperatives are eligible)

The [Main Street Employee Ownership Act of 2018](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5236) expanded SBA support for employee ownership transitions.
