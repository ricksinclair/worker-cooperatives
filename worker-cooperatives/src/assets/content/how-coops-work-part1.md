# How Worker Cooperatives Work

## The Practical Guide to Democratic Business Ownership

Worker cooperatives flip the traditional employer-employee relationship on its head. Instead of working *for* someone else, you work *with* your fellow worker-owners, sharing in the decisions, risks, and rewards of the business you run together.

This page breaks down exactly how that works in practice.

## Ownership Structure: How Workers Own the Business

### Member Shares and Buy-In

Every worker-owner holds one equal share of the cooperative. No one can own more than one share, no share is worth more than another, and shares cannot be sold or transferred to outsiders. [^1]

The initial purchase price for that ownership stake varies widely:

| Buy-In Range | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| **$25 - $500** | Entry-level service cooperatives, small retail |
| **$500 - $2,000** | Home care, food service, cleaning cooperatives |
| **$2,000 - $10,000+** | Manufacturing, professional services, tech cooperatives |

**Real-world examples:**
- **Home Care Associates of Philadelphia**: $500 buy-in via payroll deduction [^2]
- **Casa Nueva (Athens, OH)**: $1,800 deducted from paychecks over time [^2]
- **Gem City Market (Dayton, OH)**: $100 standard share ($10 for low-income members) [^2]

Most cooperatives offer payment plans, allowing workers to pay their buy-in through payroll deductions over months or years. If you leave the cooperative, you get your initial investment back. [^3]

### Equity and Internal Capital Accounts

Beyond the initial buy-in, worker-owners build equity through **internal capital accounts**. Here is how they work:

1. The cooperative earns a surplus (profit) at year's end
2. A portion of that surplus is credited to each worker-owner's individual capital account
3. These accounts earn interest over time
4. When you leave or retire, your accumulated balance is paid out

This system solves the "horizon problem" - it gives workers nearing retirement a financial stake that grows with the business, not just a share they can not cash out. [^4]
