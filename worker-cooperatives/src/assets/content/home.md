# Welcome to the Future of Work

## Workers Own. Workers Decide. Workers Thrive.

A worker cooperative is a business owned and democratically controlled by its employees. Instead of distant investors calling the shots and taking the profits, the people who do the work share ownership, make decisions together, and build wealth for themselves and their communities.

This isn't a utopian dream. It's a proven business model operating successfully across the globe—from bakeries in the Bay Area to billion-dollar manufacturing federations in Spain.

## What Makes Worker Cooperatives Different?

Worker cooperatives flip the traditional business model on its head:

- **You own where you work** — Employees hold equity stakes, not outside shareholders
- **One person, one vote** — Democratic governance means everyone has an equal say, regardless of how much they invested
- **Profits stay with workers** — Surplus gets distributed to those who created it, based on their contribution
- **Shared prosperity and risk** — Workers collectively benefit from success and navigate challenges together

These businesses operate in every industry you can imagine: manufacturing, tech, healthcare, retail, construction, professional services, restaurants, and more.

## Why Worker Cooperatives Matter

### For Workers

**Better pay and benefits.** Jobs at worker cooperatives offer competitive wages with profit-sharing on top. The average wage at U.S. worker co-ops is $19.67 per hour—more than twice the federal minimum wage. [^1] Pay ratios are dramatically more equitable, averaging 2:1 compared to the typical corporation's 351:1 ratio. [^1]

**Job security and stability.** Worker cooperatives are more resilient to economic downturns. In the U.S., they survive their first 6-10 years at a rate 7% higher than traditional small businesses. [^2] During the 2008 financial crisis in France, employment at worker cooperatives grew by 4.2% while employment at other businesses declined by 0.7%. [^3]

**Voice and dignity at work.** You're not just a cog in someone else's machine. You have a real say in how the business operates, what it prioritizes, and where it's headed.

**Wealth building.** Ownership means you build equity over time. When the business succeeds, you benefit directly—not just through wages, but through accumulated ownership value.

### For Communities

**Money stays local.** Profits don't flow to distant investors. They stay with workers who live in and spend money within the community, strengthening the local economy. [^3]

**Stable employment.** Worker cooperatives prioritize job retention. Rather than laying people off during downturns, they often reduce hours across the board, distributing hardship equitably instead of concentrating it on the most vulnerable.

**Community investment.** Many worker cooperatives, following the Mondragon model, dedicate a portion of their surplus to education, development, and community programs.

**Resilient local economies.** Communities with higher densities of cooperatives show greater economic resilience and wealth retention. [^3]

### For the Economy

**It works at scale.** The Mondragon Corporation in Spain employs over 80,000 people across more than 80 cooperatives, generating €11+ billion in annual revenue. The Emilia-Romagna region of Italy has cooperatives accounting for roughly 30% of regional GDP and consistently ranks among Italy's wealthiest areas.

**Growth is accelerating.** In the United States, the number of worker cooperatives has tripled over the past decade and grown 20% in just the last two years. [^4] As of 2023, there are approximately 751 known worker cooperatives generating over $480 million in annual revenue. [^4]

**Proven resilience.** An analysis of all businesses in Uruguay between 1997-2009 found that worker cooperatives have a 29% smaller chance of closure compared to traditional businesses. [^3] In France, the three-year survival rate for worker cooperatives is 80-90%, versus 66% for all businesses. [^3]

## Success Stories: It Works in the Real World

### Mondragon Corporation (Spain)
Founded in 1956 by a small group of workers in the Basque Country, Mondragon has grown into the world's largest federation of worker cooperatives. It operates across finance, manufacturing, retail, and education, demonstrating that democratic ownership can scale to compete globally while maintaining its core values.

### Cooperative Home Care Associates (Bronx, NY)
The largest worker cooperative in the United States, with over 2,000 worker-owners providing home healthcare. CHCA proves that the cooperative model can transform low-wage service work into quality jobs with dignity, stability, and pathways to ownership.

### John Lewis Partnership (United Kingdom)
One of the UK's largest retailers with 80,000+ employee-partners. Employees own the company, share profits through annual bonuses, and participate in governance through elected councils. Decades of profitable operation demonstrate cooperative viability at scale in retail.

### The Industrial Commons (North Carolina)
Revitalizing rural Western North Carolina through worker-owned manufacturing cooperatives, creating stable jobs with virtually zero turnover in communities recovering from offshoring. [^2] A model for economic development that centers worker ownership.

### Arizmendi Bakeries (San Francisco Bay Area)
A network of worker-owned bakeries inspired by Mondragon's principles. Each location is independently owned by its workers while sharing recipes, branding, and practices—demonstrating how cooperatives can replicate through federation.

## Common Questions Answered

**Can cooperatives raise capital?**
Yes. They use non-voting debt, preferred shares, retained earnings, and cooperative banks. Mondragon operates its own bank specifically to finance cooperative development.

**Are decisions too slow?**
No. Mature cooperatives use representative governance—elected councils oversee hired professional management. Day-to-day operations run like any business. Workers vote on major strategic decisions, not daily operations.

**Do workers have the expertise to run a business?**
Cooperatives hire professional managers and rely on elected councils for oversight, just like conventional corporations rely on boards. Many, including Mondragon, invest heavily in member education and training.

## The Bottom Line

Worker cooperatives aren't a fantasy. They're businesses that compete successfully in real markets while putting workers first. They create better jobs, build community wealth, and prove that democratic ownership can work at scale.

The question isn't whether they can work—seven decades of Mondragon's operation and thousands of cooperatives worldwide have answered that. The question is: will you be part of building an economy where workers have real ownership, voice, and power?
