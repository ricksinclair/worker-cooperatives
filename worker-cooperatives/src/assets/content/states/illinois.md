# How to Open a Worker Cooperative in Illinois

A comprehensive guide to forming and operating a worker-owned cooperative business in the State of Illinois.

---

## 1. Quick Summary

Illinois stands out as one of the most favorable states for worker cooperative formation in the United States. The state enacted the **Limited Worker Cooperative Association Act (LWCAA)** in 2019, creating a dedicated business entity specifically designed for worker-owned enterprises. This legislation makes Illinois one of approximately 15 states with a purpose-built worker cooperative statute.

### What Makes Illinois Unique

- **Dedicated Worker Cooperative Entity**: The LWCAA (805 ILCS 317) provides a tailored legal structure that enshrines cooperative principles directly into state law
- **Securities Exemption**: Worker cooperative membership interests are exempt from Illinois Securities Law registration requirements, reducing startup costs significantly
- **Immigration-Friendly**: The law explicitly allows worker-owners to participate without work authorization, classifying members as owners rather than employees
- **Sweat Equity Provisions**: Worker-owners can contribute labor ("sweat equity") rather than requiring purely financial investment
- **Worker Control Mandate**: Workers must own at least 51% of the cooperative, ensuring democratic governance
- **Active Support Ecosystem**: Chicago and the greater Illinois region have a robust network of cooperative development organizations

### Common Entity Choices for Worker Cooperatives in Illinois

| Entity Type | Best For | Key Characteristics |
|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| Limited Worker Cooperative Association (LWCA) | Most worker cooperatives | Purpose-built for worker ownership, securities exemption, democratic governance |
| LLC with Cooperative Operating Agreement | Flexibility seekers | Standard LLC with cooperative principles written into operating agreement |
| Cooperative Corporation (805 ILCS 310) | Traditional cooperatives | Older statute, requires 5+ incorporators, more administrative requirements |

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives in Illinois

### Option A: Limited Worker Cooperative Association (LWCA) - Recommended

The [Limited Worker Cooperative Association Act (805 ILCS 317)](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=4016&ChapterID=65) is the preferred structure for most worker cooperatives in Illinois. Effective January 1, 2020, this statute was specifically designed for worker-owned businesses.

**Key Features:**

- **Democratic Governance**: One member, one vote structure with worker-members controlling at least 51% of the enterprise
- **Securities Law Exemption**: Membership interests, patronage refunds, and per-unit retain certificates are exempt from Illinois Securities Law of 1953 registration requirements
- **Flexible Membership Classes**: Can include both worker-members and investor-members, with worker-members maintaining control
- **Collective Worker Cooperative Option**: For fully worker-managed cooperatives where all members are worker-owners
- **Limited Liability**: Members enjoy protection similar to LLC members
- **Perpetual Duration**: Unless otherwise specified in organizational documents

**Requirements:**
- Three or more members (unless the sole organizer is a legal entity)
- Name must contain "Limited Worker Cooperative Association," "LWCA," or "L.W.C.A."
- Name cannot include "Corporation," "Incorporated," "Ltd.," "Co.," or "Limited Partnership"

**Statutory Citation**: [805 ILCS 317](https://law.justia.com/codes/illinois/chapter-805/act-805-ilcs-317/)

### Option B: LLC Structured as a Worker Cooperative

Before the LWCAA, many Illinois worker cooperatives formed as Limited Liability Companies with cooperative principles embedded in their operating agreements. This remains a viable option for certain situations.

**When to Consider an LLC:**
- You want maximum flexibility in governance structure
- You plan to convert to another structure later
- You have unique capital or membership arrangements
- You prefer a more widely recognized business form

**Key Operating Agreement Provisions for Cooperative LLCs:**
- Democratic voting rights (one member, one vote)
- Patronage-based profit distribution
- Member capital accounts
- Membership admission and exit procedures
- Restrictions on membership transfer
- Dissolution and liquidation procedures

**Filing Information:**
- Articles of Organization filing fee: $150
- Annual Report fee: $75
- Filed with: Illinois Secretary of State

### Option C: Cooperative Corporation (805 ILCS 310)

The [Illinois Co-operative Act](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2295&ChapterID=65) is an older statute that was amended in 2016 to allow worker cooperatives.

**Characteristics:**
- Requires 5 or more incorporators
- Stock limitations: No person may own more than 10 shares; shares must be between $5 and $1,000 per share
- Maximum individual investment of $10,000
- Filing fee: Approximately $281.25
- More traditional corporate structure

**When to Consider:**
- Converting an existing corporation
- Preference for traditional corporate governance
- Specific industry requirements

### Worker Cooperative-Friendly Provisions Worth Noting

1. **Member Classification**: Under the LWCAA, worker-owners are classified as owners (not employees), which can affect tax treatment and labor law applicability

2. **Capital Contributions**: Worker-members can contribute through:
   - Cash or property
   - Services rendered (sweat equity)
   - Promissory notes
   - Other binding obligations

3. **Patronage Allocations**: The LWCAA allows for flexible patronage allocation based on labor contributions rather than capital investment

4. **Investor Protections with Worker Control**: Outside investors can participate, but worker-members must maintain at least 51% ownership and control

or patronage level.
```

Net margins shall be allocated to worker-members in proportion to the
labor patronage of each member, measured by [hours worked / wages earned /
equal allocation] during the fiscal year.
```

**Collective Decision-Making (for Collective Worker Cooperatives):**

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

### Overview of Business Conversion in Illinois

With over 2.4 million U.S. businesses owned by retiring baby boomers expected to change hands in the next decade, business conversion to worker ownership presents a significant opportunity for preserving jobs and communities in Illinois.

**Illinois Statistics:**
- Over 285 employee-owned companies in Illinois
- Relatively small number of worker cooperatives (growing sector)
- Strong institutional support for conversions

### Conversion Options Comparison

| Factor | Worker Cooperative | ESOP |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| **Best Company Size** | Fewer than 100 employees; $500K-$10M revenue | 20+ employees; consistently profitable |
| **Setup Cost** | Lower (no trust required) | Higher ($80,000+ for trust setup) |
| **Ongoing Costs** | Lower (no annual valuations required) | Higher (annual stock appraisals, trustee fees) |
| **Governance** | Full democratic control (one member, one vote) | Varies; can maintain traditional management |
| **Tax Benefits** | Section 1042 rollover available for C-corps | Section 1042 rollover + ESOP tax deferral |
| **Capital Requirements** | Flexible; can use sweat equity | Typically requires significant capital |

### Worker Cooperative Conversion Process

**Step 1: Feasibility Assessment**

## 7. Common Pitfalls in Illinois

### Legal and Structural Issues

**1. Choosing the Wrong Entity Structure**
- **Pitfall**: Forming as a standard LLC or corporation without understanding LWCA benefits
- **Solution**: Carefully evaluate the LWCA's securities exemption and cooperative provisions before choosing an entity type

**2. Improper Name Designation**
- **Pitfall**: Using prohibited terms like "Inc." or "Corp." in an LWCA name, or forgetting required designations
- **Solution**: Name must include "Limited Worker Cooperative Association," "LWCA," or "L.W.C.A." and cannot include "Corporation," "Incorporated," "Ltd.," "Co.," or "Limited Partnership"

**3. Inadequate Governance Documents**
- **Pitfall**: Using generic templates that don't address cooperative-specific issues
- **Solution**: Work with an attorney experienced in cooperative law to draft comprehensive cooperative agreements

### Financial Challenges

**4. Insufficient Capitalization**
- **Pitfall**: Starting without adequate capital reserves
- **Solution**: Develop realistic financial projections; explore Seed Commons and other non-extractive financing options

**5. Confusion About Patronage Allocations**
- **Pitfall**: Not understanding how to properly calculate and distribute patronage dividends
- **Solution**: Establish clear allocation formulas in your cooperative agreement; consult with a cooperative-experienced accountant

**6. Banking Difficulties**
- **Pitfall**: Some banks are unfamiliar with cooperatives and may create obstacles for multi-owner businesses
- **Solution**: Seek out credit unions and community banks experienced with cooperatives; IWCA can provide referrals

### Operational Issues

**7. Municipal Licensing Confusion**
- **Pitfall**: Local agencies unfamiliar with cooperative business structures
- **Solution**: Bring documentation explaining LWCAs; connect with IWCA for advocacy support if needed

**8. Insurance Challenges**
- **Pitfall**: Difficulty obtaining business insurance for multi-owner structures
- **Solution**: Work with insurance agents experienced in cooperative or partnership business models

**9. Neglecting Annual Report Filing**
- **Pitfall**: Missing the annual report deadline, risking administrative dissolution
- **Solution**: Mark your calendar for the filing deadline (before the first day of your anniversary month); set up reminders

### Governance Challenges

**10. Insufficient Member Education**
- **Pitfall**: Members don't understand their rights, responsibilities, or cooperative principles
- **Solution**: Implement ongoing member education; consider probationary periods for new members

**11. Decision-Making Paralysis**
- **Pitfall**: Overly complex consensus processes that slow operations
- **Solution**: Balance democratic participation with operational efficiency; establish clear decision-making thresholds

**12. Investor-Member Imbalance**
- **Pitfall**: Allowing outside investors too much control
- **Solution**: LWCA requires worker-members to maintain at least 51% control; carefully structure investor rights

### Tax and Employment Issues

**13. Misunderstanding Employment Classification**
- **Pitfall**: Confusion about whether worker-owners are employees or owners for tax purposes
- **Solution**: Consult with a tax professional experienced in cooperative taxation; the LWCA classifies members as owners, but this doesn't eliminate all employment-related obligations

**14. Ignoring State and Local Tax Obligations**
- **Pitfall**: Failing to register with IDOR or obtain local licenses
- **Solution**: Complete all registrations before commencing business; use MyTax Illinois for IDOR registration

## 8. FAQs for Illinois

### Q1: What is the difference between the Limited Worker Cooperative Association Act and the older Illinois Co-operative Act?

The **Limited Worker Cooperative Association Act (805 ILCS 317)**, effective January 1, 2020, was specifically designed for worker-owned businesses. It offers:
- Securities exemption for membership interests
- Flexible membership without work authorization requirements
- Modern governance provisions
- Only 3 members required (vs. 5 for Co-operative Act)
- $100 filing fee

The **Illinois Co-operative Act (805 ILCS 310)** is the older statute, originally designed for consumer and producer cooperatives. It requires 5+ incorporators, has stock ownership limitations, and costs approximately $281.25 to file.

For most worker cooperatives, the LWCA is the recommended structure.

### Q2: Do worker-owners in an Illinois LWCA need work authorization?

No. One of the key features of the Limited Worker Cooperative Association Act is that it does not require work authorization for worker-owners. The law classifies worker-members as owners rather than employees, creating broader access to cooperative ownership for immigrant communities.

However, this classification is specific to Illinois state law. Federal employment law may apply differently depending on your specific circumstances. Consulting with an immigration attorney is advisable for specific situations.

### Q3: How much does it cost to form a worker cooperative in Illinois?

**Minimum Required Costs:**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| LWCA Articles of Organization | $100 |
| EIN (Federal) | Free |
| IDOR Registration | Free |

**Optional/Recommended Costs:**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Name Reservation | $25 |
| Expedited Processing | $100 |
| Legal Assistance | Varies ($1,500-$5,000+) |
| Accounting Setup | Varies |

**Ongoing Costs:**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Annual Report | $50 |
| Registered Agent (if using service) | $100-$300/year |

### Q4: Can an Illinois LWCA have investor-members who are not workers?

Yes, the LWCA allows for both worker-members and investor-members. However, worker-members must maintain at least 51% ownership and control of the cooperative. The cooperative agreement must specify:
- The classes of membership
- Voting rights for each class
- Profit/loss allocation for each class
- Restrictions on investor voting power

This structure allows cooperatives to raise capital while maintaining worker control.

### Q5: Is there a securities exemption for Illinois worker cooperatives?

Yes. Under Section 70 of the Limited Worker Cooperative Association Act, membership interests, patronage refunds, per-unit retain certificates, and evidence of membership issued or sold by an LWCA are exempt from the registration requirements of the Illinois Securities Law of 1953. Members can sell these interests without registering as a broker or dealer.

This exemption significantly reduces the cost and complexity of forming a worker cooperative compared to structures that require securities registration.

### Q6: What are the annual compliance requirements for an Illinois LWCA?

**Annual Requirements:**
1. **Annual Report**: File Form LWCA 36 with the Secretary of State before the first day of your anniversary month; fee is $50
2. **Tax Filings**: File appropriate federal and state tax returns
3. **IDOR Compliance**: Maintain current registration and file required returns (sales tax, withholding, etc.)
4. **Registered Agent**: Maintain a registered agent in Illinois

**Failure to file the annual report may result in administrative dissolution of the cooperative.**

### Q7: Can I convert my existing Illinois business to a worker cooperative?

Yes. Illinois businesses can convert to worker cooperatives through various methods:
- **Asset Purchase**: Cooperative purchases business assets
- **Stock Purchase**: Cooperative purchases ownership interests
- **Merger**: Existing entity merges with new cooperative

The LWCA includes provisions for mergers and conversions. The process typically requires board approval and a two-thirds majority vote of members. For collective worker cooperatives, members must adopt the plan by two-thirds majority.

Tax advantages may be available for sellers, including the Section 1042 rollover for C-corporation stock sales. Consult with an attorney and accountant experienced in cooperative conversions.

### Q8: Where can I find an attorney or accountant experienced with Illinois worker cooperatives?

**Resources:**
- **Illinois Center for Employee Ownership (ILCEO)**: Maintains a [service provider directory](https://www.il-ceo.org/)
- **Illinois Worker Cooperative Alliance**: Can provide referrals to cooperative-experienced professionals
- **ICA Group**: Works with professional networks nationally
- **Illinois State Bar Association**: Lawyer referral service
- **SBDC Network**: Can connect you with professional resources

When interviewing professionals, ask about their specific experience with:
- Worker cooperatives or employee-owned businesses
- The Limited Worker Cooperative Association Act
- Patronage allocation and cooperative taxation
