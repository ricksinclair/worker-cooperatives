# How to Start a Worker Cooperative in Kentucky

A comprehensive guide to forming and operating a worker-owned cooperative business in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

---

## 1. Quick Summary

Kentucky offers a distinctive environment for worker cooperatives, featuring dedicated cooperative statutes and a growing support ecosystem rooted in Appalachian community development traditions. The Commonwealth has two cooperative-specific statutes: **KRS Chapter 272** (Cooperative Corporations and Associations) and **KRS Chapter 272A** (Kentucky Uniform Limited Cooperative Association Act), providing clear legal frameworks for cooperative formation.

### What Makes Kentucky Unique

- **Strong cooperative statutes**: Kentucky adopted the Uniform Limited Cooperative Association Act (ULCAA), providing a modern, flexible framework designed specifically for cooperatives
- **Appalachian cooperative tradition**: Eastern Kentucky has a rich history of cooperative economic development, with organizations like the Mountain Association actively supporting worker ownership
- **Business succession opportunity**: Over 26,000 Kentucky businesses owned by baby boomers represent significant conversion potential
- **Agricultural cooperative infrastructure**: While historically focused on agricultural co-ops, the support infrastructure (like KCARD) increasingly assists worker cooperatives
- **Low filing fees**: Kentucky maintains relatively low business formation costs ($40 for most entity types)

### Common Entity Choices for Worker Cooperatives

| Entity Type | Statute | Best For | Filing Fee |
|-------------|---------|----------|------------|
| Limited Cooperative Association | KRS 272A | Most worker co-ops; modern, flexible structure | $40 |
| Cooperative Corporation | KRS 272 | Traditional co-ops, especially agricultural | $40 |
| LLC (cooperative operating agreement) | KRS 275 | Small groups wanting LLC flexibility | $40 |
| Nonprofit Corporation | KRS 273 | Mission-driven co-ops prioritizing community benefit | $8 |

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives

### Option A: Limited Cooperative Association (KRS Chapter 272A)

Kentucky's adoption of the **Kentucky Uniform Limited Cooperative Association Act** ([KRS Chapter 272A](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/chapter.aspx?id=38567)) provides a modern, purpose-built framework for worker cooperatives.

**Key Features:**
- **Democratic governance**: Supports one-member, one-vote principles
- **Flexible membership classes**: Allows for patron members (workers) and investor members with different rights
- **Patronage allocations**: Expressly permits distribution of net margins based on labor patronage
- **Limited liability**: Members protected from personal liability for cooperative debts
- **Hybrid flexibility**: Combines benefits of cooperatives with LLC-style operational flexibility

**Worker-Cooperative-Friendly Provisions in KRS 272A:**
- Subchapter 5 (Members) addresses membership rights, voting, and classes
- Subchapter 6 covers member interests in the cooperative
- Subchapter 10 (Contributions, Allocations, and Distributions) provides framework for patronage dividends
- Subchapter 8 covers board of directors and officers

**Formation Requirements:**
- File Articles of Association with the Kentucky Secretary of State
- Minimum of one organizer required
- Must designate registered agent and registered office in Kentucky
- Adopt bylaws governing internal operations

### Option B: Cooperative Corporation (KRS Chapter 272)

[KRS Chapter 272](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/chapter.aspx?id=38566) governs traditional Cooperative Corporations and Associations, with historical emphasis on agricultural cooperatives.

**Key Provisions:**
- KRS 272.020: Organization of cooperative corporation, officers, votes, quorum
- KRS 272.131: Articles of association contents and filing requirements
- KRS 272.141: Amendments to articles
- One-member, one-vote governance typically required

**Best For:**
- Traditional cooperative structures
- Agricultural or rural cooperatives
- Groups wanting well-established legal precedent

**Important Note:** The word "cooperative" may not be used in the name of any for-profit entity in Kentucky unless it complies with KRS 272.020.

### Option C: LLC with Cooperative Operating Agreement

Many Kentucky worker cooperatives form as a standard **Limited Liability Company** under [KRS Chapter 275](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/chapter.aspx?id=38565) and structure cooperative governance through a detailed operating agreement.

**Advantages:**
- Maximum flexibility in structuring membership, voting, and profit allocation
- Familiar entity type for attorneys, banks, and business partners
- Pass-through taxation by default
- Well-established legal framework

**Operating Agreement Must Address:**
- One-member, one-vote provisions (or other democratic structure)
- Membership admission and exit procedures
- Capital account structure
- Patronage allocation methodology
- Buyout procedures for departing members
- Governance and decision-making processes

**Filing Fee:** $40

### Option D: Nonprofit Cooperative

For worker cooperatives prioritizing mission over profit distribution, a **Nonprofit Corporation** under [KRS Chapter 273](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/chapter.aspx?id=38564) may be appropriate.

**Considerations:**
- Cannot distribute profits to members as patronage
- May qualify for 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) federal tax exemption
- Useful for social enterprises, community-benefit cooperatives
- Filing fee: $8

### Comparison: Which Structure to Choose?

| Factor | Limited Coop Assn (272A) | Coop Corporation (272) | LLC | Nonprofit |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----|-----------|
| Specifically designed for co-ops | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Patronage distributions | Expressly permitted | Permitted | Via operating agreement | Not permitted |
| Investor members allowed | Yes (limited voting) | Limited | Yes | No |
| Pass-through taxation | Optional | No (typically) | Default | Tax-exempt option |
| Legal familiarity | Moderate | Moderate | High | Moderate |
| Filing fee | $40 | $40 | $40 | $8 |

## 4. Governance and Documents to Prepare

### Essential Governing Documents

**1. Bylaws (for Cooperative Corporations and Limited Cooperative Associations) or Operating Agreement (for LLCs)**

This is the most critical document for a worker cooperative, defining how the business operates democratically.

**Key Provisions to Include:**

**2. Member Handbook/Policies**

Separate from bylaws, covering:

### Sample Bylaw Provisions for Kentucky Worker Cooperatives

**Patronage Allocation Example:**
"Net margins shall be allocated to members in proportion to the total hours worked by each member during the fiscal year. The cooperative shall retain [X]% of allocated patronage in member capital accounts, with the remainder distributed in cash within [90] days of fiscal year end, subject to cash flow requirements determined by the Board."

**Membership Classes Example (for Limited Cooperative Association):**
"The cooperative shall have two classes of members: (a) Worker-Members, who must work at least [X] hours per week and shall have full voting rights on a one-member, one-vote basis; and (b) Investor-Members, who contribute capital and shall be limited to [Y]% of total votes on any matter."

**Democratic Control Example:**
"Each Worker-Member in good standing shall have one vote on all matters submitted to the membership, regardless of capital contribution or patronage level. Major decisions including amendments to these Bylaws, dissolution, merger, or sale of substantially all assets shall require approval of [two-thirds/three-fourths] of Worker-Members."

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

### The Kentucky Opportunity

Kentucky faces a significant business succession challenge: over 26,000 businesses employing more than 300,000 people are owned by baby boomers, many without succession plans. Worker cooperative conversion offers a path to:
- Keep businesses locally owned and operating
- Preserve jobs in communities
- Build wealth for working families

### Conversion Process Overview

**Phase 1: Assessment (3-6 months)**
1. Owner expresses interest in selling to employees
2. Assess business viability and employee interest
3. Conduct preliminary valuation
4. Engage cooperative development professionals (KCARD, Mountain Association)

**Phase 2: Feasibility and Planning (3-6 months)**
1. Detailed feasibility study
2. Business valuation (typically by independent appraiser)
3. Financial projections under cooperative model
4. Employee education about cooperative ownership
5. Preliminary transaction structure

**Phase 3: Transaction and Formation (3-6 months)**
1. Form cooperative entity (typically new LLC or Limited Cooperative Association)
2. Negotiate purchase terms with selling owner
3. Arrange financing (seller financing often a key component)
4. Draft governing documents
5. Conduct member buy-in process
6. Close transaction

**Phase 4: Transition (6-24 months)**
1. Implement cooperative governance
2. Owner transition/knowledge transfer
3. Member education and training
4. Establish financial systems (patronage accounting)

### ESOP vs. Worker Cooperative Conversion

| Factor | Worker Cooperative | ESOP |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| Governance | One-member, one-vote | Typically trustee-controlled |
| Size | Any size (often smaller) | Usually 15+ employees |
| Tax benefits | State-level benefits vary | Significant federal tax benefits |
| Complexity | Moderate | High (requires trustee, annual valuation) |
| Cost to establish | Lower | Higher (legal, trustee, valuation fees) |
| Democratic control | Inherent | Optional |
| Best for | Small-medium businesses; mission-driven | Larger businesses; tax-driven transactions |

**Hybrid Approaches:** Some businesses use ESOPs with cooperative-style governance, gaining tax benefits while maintaining democratic principles.

**Kentucky ESOP Example:** Houchens Industries in Bowling Green is one of the largest 100% employee-owned companies in the US, demonstrating Kentucky's employee ownership potential.

### Key Conversion Considerations for Kentucky

- **Valuation:** Kentucky has no specific cooperative valuation requirements; standard fair market value methods apply
- **Financing:** Seller financing is common; Mountain Association and CDFIs may participate
- **Legal structure:** Most conversions result in new LLC or Limited Cooperative Association purchasing assets or stock
- **Tax implications:** Consult qualified accountant regarding Kentucky and federal tax treatment

## 7. Common Pitfalls in Kentucky

### Formation Pitfalls

**1. Not Using the Right Entity**
- Pitfall: Forming a standard LLC without proper cooperative provisions in the operating agreement
- Solution: Either use KRS 272A (Limited Cooperative Association) or ensure LLC operating agreement explicitly establishes cooperative principles, patronage allocation, and democratic governance

**2. Ignoring the "Cooperative" Name Restriction**
- Pitfall: Using "cooperative" in business name without complying with KRS 272.020
- Solution: If you want "cooperative" in your name, form under KRS 272 or KRS 272A, or consult an attorney about compliance requirements

**3. Inadequate Governing Documents**
- Pitfall: Using template bylaws/operating agreements not designed for worker cooperatives
- Solution: Work with KCARD or an attorney experienced in cooperative law to draft documents addressing membership, patronage, voting, and capital structure

**4. Missing the County Filing**
- Pitfall: After incorporation, failing to file with the county clerk where registered office is located
- Solution: Remember this additional step after Secretary of State filing

### Tax Pitfalls

**5. Underestimating LLET Obligations**
- Pitfall: Assuming cooperative status exempts entity from Kentucky's Limited Liability Entity Tax
- Solution: Budget for at least $175/year LLET minimum; consult tax professional about cooperative-specific exemptions

**6. Failing to Register with Department of Revenue Timely**
- Pitfall: Not registering 30 days before engaging in taxable activity
- Solution: Register via [MyTaxes.ky.gov](https://mytaxes.ky.gov) as part of formation process

**7. Overlooking Local Occupational Taxes**
- Pitfall: Many Kentucky cities/counties impose occupational license taxes that new businesses miss
- Solution: Research local requirements for each location where you operate or have employees

### Governance Pitfalls

**8. Unclear Patronage Methodology**
- Pitfall: Not defining how patronage is calculated (hours? wages? equal?)
- Solution: Clearly specify patronage calculation in bylaws, ensuring workers understand how allocations work

**9. Insufficient Capital at Formation**
- Pitfall: Starting with inadequate member buy-ins and no capital reserves
- Solution: Conduct financial planning; set meaningful (but accessible) member capital contributions; establish reserve policies

**10. Deferred Member Accounts Without Cash Flow Planning**
- Pitfall: Allocating large patronage amounts to member accounts without plan to redeem them
- Solution: Establish clear redemption schedules; maintain adequate liquidity; consider revolving fund approach

### Compliance Pitfalls

**11. Missing Annual Report Deadline**
- Pitfall: Failing to file annual report by June 30
- Solution: Set calendar reminder; file online via Kentucky Business One Stop; budget $15 annual fee

**12. Registered Agent Lapse**
- Pitfall: Registered agent no longer available, leading to missed service of process
- Solution: Maintain current registered agent; file change form promptly if agent changes; consider professional service

### Operational Pitfalls

**13. Inadequate Member Education**
- Pitfall: Workers become members without understanding cooperative principles, obligations, and rights
- Solution: Develop member education program; require orientation before membership; provide ongoing governance training

**14. Not Planning for Member Departures**
- Pitfall: No clear process or funding for buying out departing members
- Solution: Include clear buyout terms in bylaws; establish internal financing for redemptions; consider departing member payment schedule

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions (Kentucky-Specific)

### Q1: Does Kentucky have a specific worker cooperative statute?

**A:** Kentucky does not have a statute exclusively for worker cooperatives, but it has two cooperative-specific statutes that worker cooperatives commonly use:
- **KRS Chapter 272A** (Kentucky Uniform Limited Cooperative Association Act) - the most flexible modern option
- **KRS Chapter 272** (Cooperative Corporations and Associations) - traditional cooperative corporation statute

Additionally, many worker cooperatives form as LLCs under KRS Chapter 275 with cooperative provisions in the operating agreement.

### Q2: What is the minimum number of people needed to start a worker cooperative in Kentucky?

**A:** Kentucky does not specify a minimum number of members to form a cooperative:
- **Limited Cooperative Association (KRS 272A):** Requires at least one organizer; no statutory minimum membership
- **LLC:** Requires at least one member
- **Cooperative Corporation (KRS 272):** Check specific provisions; typically requires at least three incorporators for corporations

Practically, most worker cooperatives function best with at least 3-5 founding members to enable meaningful democratic governance.

### Q3: How is the Limited Liability Entity Tax (LLET) applied to worker cooperatives?

**A:** Worker cooperatives organized as LLCs, limited cooperative associations, or corporations are generally subject to Kentucky's LLET:
- **Minimum tax:** $175/year
- **Small business exemption:** Full exemption for entities with gross receipts/profits under $3 million (they pay only the $175 minimum)
- Certain exemptions may apply to specific cooperative structures

Consult with a Kentucky tax professional to determine how LLET applies to your specific cooperative structure and whether any exemptions apply.

### Q4: Can a worker cooperative use "cooperative" in its name?

**A:** Yes, but there are restrictions. Under KRS 272.020, the word "cooperative" may not be used in the name of any for-profit entity in Kentucky unless it complies with the cooperative corporation statute. If you form under KRS 272 or KRS 272A, using "cooperative" in your name is straightforward. If forming an LLC, consult with an attorney about compliance requirements.

### Q5: Is KCARD only for agricultural cooperatives, or can they help worker cooperatives?

**A:** While KCARD (Kentucky Center for Agriculture and Rural Development) has historical roots in agricultural cooperatives, they provide development assistance to cooperatives of all types, including worker cooperatives. Their services through the USDA Rural Cooperative Development Grant program are often available at little or no cost. Contact them to discuss your worker cooperative project.

### Q6: What local taxes do Kentucky worker cooperatives need to be aware of?

**A:** Kentucky has significant local taxation:
- Many cities and counties impose **occupational license taxes** (often calculated on gross receipts, net profits, or payroll)
- **Net profits taxes** in various jurisdictions
- **Local payroll withholding** in some areas

There is no single statewide database, so you must research requirements for each city/county where you operate or have employees. The [Kentucky Business One Stop Portal](https://onestop.ky.gov/manage/Pages/permits.aspx) and local government websites are starting points.

### Q7: How do I convert an existing Kentucky business to a worker cooperative?

**A:** The typical conversion process involves:
1. Assessing business viability and employee interest
2. Obtaining a professional business valuation
3. Forming a new cooperative entity (often LLC or Limited Cooperative Association)
4. Negotiating purchase terms with current owner
5. Arranging financing (seller financing is common)
6. Transferring assets or stock to the cooperative
7. Implementing cooperative governance

KCARD and Mountain Association have experience assisting Kentucky business conversions. Project Equity and Democracy at Work Institute have also conducted conversion trainings in Kentucky.

### Q8: What annual compliance requirements apply to Kentucky worker cooperatives?

**A:** Key annual requirements include:
- **Annual Report:** Due June 30 each year to Secretary of State ($15 fee)
- **LLET:** File and pay Limited Liability Entity Tax (minimum $175) with annual income tax return
- **State income/withholding taxes:** File with Department of Revenue per your registration
- **Federal taxes:** Form 1120-C (cooperatives) or applicable entity return (LLC typically Form 1065)
- **Unemployment insurance:** Quarterly reports to Kentucky Office of Unemployment Insurance
- **Local taxes:** Per jurisdiction requirements

Additionally, maintain internal cooperative compliance: hold member meetings, maintain minutes, conduct board elections, and distribute patronage allocations according to bylaws.
