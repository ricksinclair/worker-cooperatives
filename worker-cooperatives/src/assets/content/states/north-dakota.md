# How to Start a Worker Cooperative in North Dakota

A comprehensive guide to forming, funding, and operating a worker-owned cooperative business in North Dakota.

---

## 1. Quick Summary: What Makes North Dakota Unique

North Dakota offers a distinctive environment for worker cooperatives, shaped by several key factors:

**Strong Agricultural Cooperative Tradition**: North Dakota has one of the deepest cooperative traditions in the United States. The state's rural electric cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives, and credit unions have operated successfully for generations. The [North Dakota Association of Rural Electric Cooperatives (NDAREC)](https://www.ndarec.com/) was founded in 1942 and today represents 17 electric distribution cooperatives and five generation and transmission cooperatives serving over 250,000 residents across all 53 counties.

**The Bank of North Dakota (BND)**: North Dakota is home to the only state-owned bank in the nation. The [Bank of North Dakota](https://bnd.nd.gov/) partners with local lenders to offer numerous low-interest loan programs for new and expanding businesses, including programs specifically designed for cooperative ventures and rural economic development.

**Rural Development Focus**: The state has established infrastructure specifically supporting cooperative development through organizations like the [Rural Development Finance Corporation (RDFC)](https://www.ndarec.com/rdfc), which provides low-interest revolving loan programs for cooperative ventures and community development projects benefiting rural communities.

**Cooperative-Friendly Legal Framework**: North Dakota Century Code [Chapter 10-15](https://ndlegis.gov/cencode/t10c15.html) provides a dedicated statutory framework for cooperative associations, allowing formation for nearly any lawful business purpose.

**Pro-Business Environment**: With no corporate income tax on certain business structures, relatively low regulatory burden, and a culture that values self-reliance and community cooperation, North Dakota presents a welcoming environment for worker-owned enterprises.

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives in North Dakota

Worker cooperatives in North Dakota can choose from several legal structures. Each has distinct advantages depending on your specific circumstances.

### Option A: Cooperative Association (N.D.C.C. Chapter 10-15)

North Dakota's [Cooperative Associations Act](https://law.justia.com/codes/north-dakota/2021/title-10/chapter-10-15/) provides a dedicated legal framework specifically designed for cooperatives.

**Key Requirements:**
- Minimum of 5 adult incorporators (at least one must be a North Dakota resident)
- Cannot be formed for banking or insurance purposes
- Must file Articles of Association with the Secretary of State
- Members share equally in control and elect directors from among themselves

**Advantages:**
- Purpose-built for cooperative governance
- Clear statutory framework for member rights, voting, and patronage
- Familiar structure to lenders and support organizations with cooperative experience
- Strong legal precedent from North Dakota's long cooperative history

**Considerations:**
- May require more explanation to partners unfamiliar with cooperatives
- Less flexibility in governance customization compared to LLCs

### Option B: Limited Liability Company (LLC) with Cooperative Operating Agreement

Under [N.D.C.C. Chapter 10-32.1](https://law.justia.com/codes/north-dakota/title-10/chapter-10-32-1/) (Uniform Limited Liability Company Act), you can form an LLC and structure it cooperatively through your operating agreement.

**Key Features:**
- Filing fee: $135 for Articles of Organization
- Operating agreement can be oral, written, or implied (written strongly recommended)
- Amendment requires unanimous member approval unless otherwise specified
- Annual report due November 15 ($50 fee)

**Advantages:**
- Maximum flexibility in governance design
- Familiar structure to banks, investors, and attorneys
- Can incorporate cooperative principles (one-member-one-vote, patronage dividends) in operating agreement
- Pass-through taxation by default

**Considerations:**
- Must carefully draft operating agreement to embed cooperative principles
- No statutory cooperative framework to fall back on
- May not qualify for certain cooperative-specific programs or tax treatments

### Option C: Corporation with Cooperative Bylaws

A traditional corporation ([N.D.C.C. Chapter 10-19.1](https://ndlegis.gov/cencode/t10c19-1.pdf)) can be structured with cooperative principles in its bylaws.

**Considerations:**
- More complex structure with potential double taxation (unless S-corp election)
- Less common for worker cooperatives
- May be appropriate for larger operations or specific circumstances

### Recommended Approach

For most worker cooperatives in North Dakota, the **Cooperative Association** structure under Chapter 10-15 is recommended due to:
- Clear legal framework designed for cooperative operations
- Alignment with North Dakota's cooperative tradition
- Recognition by cooperative-focused lenders and support organizations

For smaller groups (under 5 members) or those seeking maximum flexibility, the **LLC with cooperative operating agreement** may be more practical.

> **Note**: This guide provides general information only. Consult with an attorney familiar with cooperative law to determine the best structure for your specific situation.

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

Converting an existing business to worker ownership can preserve jobs, maintain community wealth, and provide a meaningful exit for retiring owners.

### Why Consider Conversion?

- **Business Succession**: Many North Dakota business owners are approaching retirement without clear succession plans
- **Employee Retention**: Worker ownership increases engagement and reduces turnover
- **Community Stability**: Keeps businesses locally owned and profits circulating locally
- **Legacy Preservation**: Maintains the owner's business legacy

### Conversion Process Overview

**Phase 1: Exploration**
1. Owner assesses readiness and motivation for selling to employees
2. Employees gauge interest in ownership
3. Both parties explore cooperative structure and implications
4. Engage professional advisors (attorney, accountant, cooperative developer)

**Phase 2: Feasibility**
1. Business valuation by qualified appraiser
2. Financial analysis and projections
3. Governance structure design
4. Preliminary financing exploration
5. Due diligence on business operations

**Phase 3: Transaction Planning**
1. Negotiate purchase terms
2. Develop transition timeline
3. Structure financing (seller financing often key component)
4. Draft legal documents
5. Plan management transition

**Phase 4: Implementation**
1. Close transaction
2. Establish cooperative governance
3. Begin member education program
4. Transition operations
5. Ongoing support and development

### Worker Cooperative vs. ESOP

| Factor | Worker Cooperative | ESOP |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| Governance | One member, one vote | Voting typically by shares |
| Formation Cost | Lower ($5,000-$30,000) | Higher ($50,000-$150,000+) |
| Ongoing Costs | Lower | Higher (annual valuations, compliance) |
| Tax Benefits | Subchapter T treatment | Significant tax advantages |
| Best Fit | Smaller businesses (<100 employees) | Larger businesses (50+ employees) |

For most small North Dakota businesses, worker cooperative conversion is typically more cost-effective than an ESOP.
