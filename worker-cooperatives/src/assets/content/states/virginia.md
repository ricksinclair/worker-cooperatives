# How to Start a Worker Cooperative in Virginia

Virginia offers a distinctive environment for worker cooperatives, combining a dedicated statutory framework for worker-owned businesses with proximity to the nation's capital and a diverse, robust economy. This guide provides a practical roadmap for forming a worker cooperative in the Commonwealth.

---

## 1. Quick Summary: What Makes Virginia Unique

Virginia stands out as a worker cooperative-friendly state for several compelling reasons:

**Dedicated Worker Cooperative Statute (2020)**: Virginia is one of the few states with specific legislation governing worker cooperatives under [Title 13.1, Chapter 3, Article 3 of the Code of Virginia](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title13.1/chapter3/article3/). Enacted in 2020 (c. 673), this provides clear legal recognition and a defined framework for worker-owned businesses, including specific provisions for membership shares, patronage allocation, and internal capital accounts.

**Proximity to Washington, D.C.**: Northern Virginia's position in the DC metropolitan area provides access to federal contracting opportunities, a large professional workforce, and a thriving solidarity economy ecosystem. Organizations like the [Greater Washington Center for Employee Ownership (GWCEO)](https://www.rochdalecapital.org/gwceo) and [CoopDC](https://coopdc.org/) extend their reach into Northern Virginia.

**Diverse Economic Base**: Virginia's economy spans technology (particularly in the Northern Virginia tech corridor), agriculture, maritime industries, healthcare, defense contracting, and professional services. This diversity creates opportunities for worker cooperatives across multiple sectors.

**Regional Cooperative Networks**: The DC metro area hosts organizations like [Democracy at Work Network (DAWN)](https://democracyatworkdc.com/) and the [DC Worker Cooperative Coalition](https://www.onedconline.org/cooprecommendations), which provide support infrastructure extending into Virginia. Richmond has its own emerging ecosystem through [Cooperation Richmond](https://cooperationrichmond.wordpress.com/).

**Historical Significance**: Virginia holds an important place in cooperative history--the first Rochdale-type Black cooperative was established in 1901 in Ruthville, Virginia.

**Strong CDFI Ecosystem**: The [Virginia CDFI Coalition](https://www.vacdficoalition.org/) connects approximately two dozen mission-driven lenders throughout the Commonwealth, potentially facilitating financing for cooperative enterprises.

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives in Virginia

Virginia provides two primary pathways for forming a worker cooperative: the dedicated Worker Cooperative Corporation statute or the flexible LLC structure.

### Option A: Worker Cooperative Corporation (Recommended)

Under [Virginia Code Section 13.1-347](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title13.1/chapter3/section13.1-347/), any corporation incorporated under Article 3 of Chapter 9 (stock corporations) may elect to be governed as a worker cooperative by stating this in its articles of incorporation or articles of amendment filed in accordance with Section 13.1-710.

**Key Statutory Definitions ([Section 13.1-346](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title13.1/chapter3/article3/)):**

- **"Member"**: An individual who has been accepted for membership in, and owns a membership share issued by, a worker cooperative
- **"Membership fee"**: An initial payment, if required by the articles or bylaws, made by a worker as a condition of becoming a member
- **"Patronage"**: The amount of work performed for a worker cooperative, measured in accordance with criteria set forth in the articles or bylaws
- **"Worker"**: An individual employed by a worker cooperative

**Key Statutory Features:**

- **Membership Shares ([Section 13.1-352](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title13.1/chapter3/article3/))**: A worker cooperative must issue a class of voting shares designated as membership shares. Each member owns exactly one membership share, purchased for a membership fee determined by the board of directors. No shares other than membership shares shall be given voting rights.

- **One Member, One Vote**: Each member with a membership share shall have one vote in any matter requiring voting by shareholders.

- **Employment Requirement ([Section 13.1-350](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title13.1/chapter3/article3/))**: Only individuals employed by the worker cooperative may own a membership share, and not fewer than two-thirds of employees must be members.

- **Internal Capital Accounts ([Section 13.1-354](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title13.1/chapter3/article3/))**: A worker cooperative shall establish through its articles or bylaws a system of internal capital accounts to reflect the book value and determine redemption price of membership shares, nonvoting shares, and written notices of allocation.

- **Patronage Allocation ([Section 13.1-355](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title13.1/chapter3/article3/))**: Net earnings declared as patronage allocations shall be apportioned among members in accordance with the ratio that each member's patronage bears to total patronage by all members.

- **Merger Restrictions ([Section 13.1-350](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title13.1/chapter3/article3/))**: A worker cooperative may not merge with another corporation other than another worker cooperative. Two or more worker cooperatives may merge in accordance with Article 12 of Chapter 9.

- **Retired Members**: The articles or bylaws may provide that an individual who retires from employment may continue as a member without voting rights.

**Advantages:**
- Clear legal recognition under Virginia law with 2020 statute
- Statutory framework provides certainty for governance and membership
- Ability to use "cooperative" or "co-op" in the business name
- Well-defined relationship between worker-ownership and membership
- Required internal capital account system provides financial transparency
- Patronage allocation rules codified in statute

**Considerations:**
- Corporate formalities (board meetings, minutes, annual reports)
- Stock corporation charter fees based on authorized shares
- Less flexibility than LLC structure
- Cannot merge with non-cooperative corporations

### Option B: Cooperative LLC

Virginia's [Limited Liability Company Act](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title13.1/chapter12/section13.1-1023/) allows for significant flexibility in structuring an LLC as a worker cooperative through its [operating agreement](https://www.scc.virginia.gov/businesses/forms-and-fees/virginia-limited-liability-companies/).

**Structure Requirements:**
- Operating agreement must define membership classes, voting rights (typically one member, one vote), and patronage-based distributions
- Governance provisions mirror cooperative principles
- Must comply with IRS Subchapter T requirements to receive cooperative tax treatment
- Democratic control provisions should be carefully drafted to prevent future amendment to non-cooperative structure

**Advantages:**
- Greater flexibility in governance structure
- Pass-through taxation (unless C-corp election made)
- Lower formation fees ($100 filing fee)
- $50 annual registration fee
- Fewer corporate formalities
- Merger flexibility (no statutory restriction)

**Considerations:**
- Cannot use "cooperative" in name under traditional cooperative statute requirements
- Must carefully draft operating agreement to establish cooperative character
- May require more legal expertise to structure properly
- Easier for future members to amend away cooperative principles through operating agreement changes

### Cooperative Associations Generally

Virginia also has general cooperative association provisions under [Article 1 of Chapter 3](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title13.1/chapter3/article1/). Under [Section 13.1-301](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title13.1/chapter3/section13.1-301/), any number of persons, not less than five, may associate together as a cooperative association for housing, agricultural, fishing, dairy, mercantile, manufacturing, service, or mechanical business on the cooperative plan. The word "cooperative" must be included in the name.

**Note**: To the extent that general cooperative provisions conflict with the worker cooperative provisions in Article 3, the worker cooperative provisions control.

### Which Structure to Choose?

| Factor | Worker Coop Corporation | Cooperative LLC |
|--------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Initial Filing Cost | $75+ (varies by shares) | $100 |
| Annual Fee | Based on authorized stock (min $25) | $50 |
| Use "Cooperative" in Name | Yes | Generally No |
| Governance Flexibility | Moderate (statute-defined) | High |
| Statutory Recognition | Explicit (2020 law) | Implicit |
| Tax Treatment | Subchapter T eligible | Flexible (pass-through or Subchapter T) |
| Merger Options | Only with other worker coops | Unrestricted |
| Internal Capital Accounts | Required by statute | Optional (recommended) |

For most worker cooperatives seeking clear legal recognition and the ability to use "cooperative" in their name, the Worker Cooperative Corporation structure under Article 3 is recommended.

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

Converting an existing business to a worker cooperative can preserve jobs, maintain community assets, and provide a succession solution for retiring owners.

### Why Consider Conversion?

- **Business Succession**: Every year, 150,000 to 300,000 businesses owned by baby boomers become candidates for employee takeovers as their owners hit retirement age
- **Employee Retention**: Worker-owners have strong incentives to remain with the business
- **Community Stability**: Keeps businesses locally owned and rooted
- **Tax Advantages**: Sellers may benefit from favorable tax treatment; cooperatives benefit from Subchapter T taxation
- **Accessibility**: Unlike ESOPs (which often require $5 million+ in annual revenue), worker cooperatives are viable for much smaller businesses with lower setup and maintenance costs

### Virginia's Conversion Pathway

Virginia's worker cooperative statute makes conversion relatively straightforward. Under [Section 13.1-347](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title13.1/chapter3/section13.1-347/), any corporation incorporated under Article 3 of Chapter 9 may elect to be governed as a worker cooperative by filing articles of amendment.

**Key Statutory Conversion Provisions:**
- When a worker cooperative revokes its election, articles of amendment must provide for conversion of membership shares and internal capital accounts in a manner consistent with Chapter 9
- Existing corporations can add worker cooperative election through articles of amendment

### Conversion Process

**Step 1: Feasibility Assessment**
- Evaluate business financial health
- Assess employee interest and capacity
- Determine fair market value
- Review existing debt and obligations

**Step 2: Structuring the Transaction**
- Determine purchase price and terms
- Structure payment (lump sum, seller financing, earnout)
- Decide between asset purchase or stock/membership purchase
- Address existing owner's continued role, if any

**Step 3: Form the Cooperative Entity**
- For existing corporations: File articles of amendment electing worker cooperative status
- For other entities: Form new worker cooperative corporation or LLC and transfer assets
- Establish initial membership structure
- Ensure two-thirds of employees become members

**Step 4: Financing the Acquisition**
Common financing sources for conversions:
- Seller financing (often significant portion)
- Bank loans or SBA-guaranteed loans
- CDFI financing
- Member contributions
- Retained earnings (internal capitalization over time)

**Step 5: Transition Planning**
- Knowledge transfer from selling owner
- Management training for worker-owners
- Governance education
- Operational documentation

### Virginia-Specific Conversion Considerations

- Virginia's worker cooperative statute allows existing corporations to elect worker cooperative status through articles of amendment
- Two-thirds of employees must become members--plan for staged membership if needed
- Consider employment continuity and membership eligibility timing
- Review any existing shareholder agreements for transfer restrictions
- Worker cooperative cannot merge with non-cooperative entity after conversion

## 7. Common Pitfalls in Virginia

### Legal and Compliance Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Ignoring the Two-Thirds Membership Requirement**
Virginia law requires that not fewer than two-thirds of employees must be members of the worker cooperative. Failing to maintain this ratio can jeopardize cooperative status.

*Solution*: Track membership ratios regularly. Establish clear pathways and timelines for employee membership eligibility. Address non-member employees through documented probationary periods or legitimate exclusions.

**Pitfall 2: Inadequate Governance Documentation**
Vague or incomplete bylaws create disputes and operational confusion. Virginia Code specifically requires that bylaws establish qualifications for membership and procedures for acceptance and termination.

*Solution*: Invest in comprehensive bylaws drafted or reviewed by an attorney familiar with cooperative law. Clearly define membership qualifications, acceptance procedures, termination processes, and dispute resolution mechanisms as required by Virginia Code.

**Pitfall 3: Missing Local Business License Requirements**
Founders focused on state filings often overlook local BPOL requirements, leading to penalties (typically 10%) and compliance issues. Localities can look back up to seven years for unpaid taxes.

*Solution*: Contact your local Commissioner of the Revenue or city/county finance department early in the formation process. Budget for local license fees based on projected revenues. Note varying deadlines (10-75 days from start of business).

**Pitfall 4: Merger Restriction Surprise**
Virginia worker cooperative corporations cannot merge with non-cooperative corporations, which may limit future strategic options.

*Solution*: Understand this limitation during entity selection. If merger flexibility is important, consider the cooperative LLC structure instead.

**Pitfall 5: Failing to Establish Internal Capital Accounts**
Virginia law requires worker cooperatives to establish internal capital account systems. Failure to comply creates statutory non-compliance and financial confusion.

*Solution*: Work with an accountant familiar with cooperative accounting to establish proper internal capital accounts for membership shares, nonvoting shares, and written notices of allocation from the start.

### Governance and Management Pitfalls

**Pitfall 6: Conflating Ownership with Management**
Democratic ownership does not mean every decision requires a vote. Attempting consensus on all matters leads to decision fatigue and operational paralysis.

*Solution*: Clearly distinguish between governance decisions (board/membership) and operational decisions (management). Establish appropriate delegation of authority. The Virginia statute allows boards to be authorized to amend bylaws--use this flexibility appropriately.

**Pitfall 7: Unclear Dispute Resolution**
Without established processes, interpersonal conflicts can escalate and threaten the cooperative's survival.

*Solution*: Include detailed grievance and dispute resolution procedures in bylaws. Consider mandatory mediation before any litigation. Train members in conflict resolution.

### Financial Pitfalls

**Pitfall 8: Undercapitalization**
Worker cooperatives often struggle to raise sufficient startup capital due to limited access to traditional equity investors.

*Solution*: Develop realistic capital requirements. Structure meaningful but achievable membership fees. Explore CDFI financing early through the Virginia CDFI Coalition and DC-area resources like GWCEO. Consider phased membership buy-in through payroll deductions. Build retained patronage into your financial model.

**Pitfall 9: Misunderstanding Patronage Tax Treatment**
Improperly structured patronage allocations may not qualify for Subchapter T deductions, resulting in unexpected tax liability.

*Solution*: Work with an accountant experienced in cooperative taxation. Follow IRS requirements for qualified written notices of allocation. Distribute at least 20% of patronage in cash within 8.5 months of year-end. Ensure patronage is properly apportioned based on members' work contribution ratios.

**Pitfall 10: Neglecting the Business Fundamentals**
The cooperative structure does not substitute for a viable business model. Poor management, inadequate marketing, or weak customer value proposition doom cooperatives just as they doom any business.

*Solution*: Treat business planning with the same rigor as any startup. Use SBDC resources--they're free. Conduct thorough market research. Build management capacity. The cooperative structure should enhance, not replace, sound business practices.

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q1: How many people do I need to start a worker cooperative in Virginia?

Under Virginia's cooperative association statute ([Section 13.1-301](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title13.1/chapter3/section13.1-301/)), not fewer than five persons may associate together to form a cooperative association. For worker cooperative corporations formed under the stock corporation statute with a cooperative election, the standard incorporator requirements apply (one or more natural persons). Practically, starting with a core group of 3-5 committed founding members is advisable, and you must ensure at least two-thirds of employees become members once operating.

### Q2: What are the ongoing filing requirements for a Virginia worker cooperative?

**Annual Registration Fee**: Stock corporations (including worker cooperative corporations) pay an annual registration fee to the SCC based on authorized shares (minimum $25). LLCs pay a $50 annual registration fee. Fees are due by the last day of the anniversary month of formation.

**Annual Report**: Virginia does not require a separate annual report filing for most corporations and LLCs; the annual registration fee payment serves this function.

**Local BPOL**: Renewal due March 1 annually in most jurisdictions.

**Tax Filings**: Federal and Virginia corporate income tax returns (if applicable), employer withholding returns, unemployment tax returns, and Form 1099-PATR for patronage distributions.

### Q3: Can non-employees be members of a Virginia worker cooperative?

No. Under [Virginia Code Section 13.1-350](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title13.1/chapter3/article3/), only individuals employed by the worker cooperative may own a membership share, and not fewer than two-thirds of employees must be members. No individual may be accepted as a member unless employed by the worker cooperative at the time of acceptance. This distinguishes worker cooperatives from consumer or producer cooperatives.

However, a retired former employee may continue as a member without voting rights if the articles or bylaws so provide.

### Q4: How are worker cooperatives taxed in Virginia?

**Federal**: Worker cooperatives that meet IRS requirements can elect taxation under [Subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.1382-2). This allows the cooperative to deduct patronage dividends from taxable income, avoiding double taxation. At least 20% of patronage must be paid in cash; the remainder can be retained as allocated patronage through written notices of allocation.

**Virginia**: Virginia generally follows federal treatment for corporate income tax purposes. Consult with a tax professional familiar with cooperative taxation for specific guidance on Virginia treatment of patronage dividends.

### Q5: What is the difference between a worker cooperative and an ESOP?

An Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) is a qualified retirement plan that holds company stock for employees. Virginia's worker cooperative statute specifically states that offering an ESOP does not constitute an election to be governed as a worker cooperative ([Section 13.1-347](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title13.1/chapter3/section13.1-347/)).

Key differences:
| Feature | Worker Cooperative | ESOP |
|---------|-------------------|------|
| Governance | One member, one vote | Voting tied to share ownership |
| Control | Workers control through membership | Trust holds shares; trustees vote |
| Employment Requirement | Members must be employees; 2/3 of employees must be members | Broader employee eligibility |
| Tax Structure | Subchapter T | Qualified retirement plan rules |
| Business Size | Viable for any size | Typically $5M+ annual revenue |
| Setup/Maintenance Cost | Lower | Higher |

### Q6: Can I convert my existing Virginia business to a worker cooperative?

Yes. An existing Virginia corporation can elect to be governed as a worker cooperative by filing articles of amendment with the SCC stating this election under Section 13.1-710. The corporation must then comply with all worker cooperative requirements, including the two-thirds membership ratio.

For LLCs or other entity types, you would typically form a new worker cooperative entity and transfer assets, or restructure the operating agreement to reflect cooperative governance. Consult with legal and tax advisors to structure the conversion properly.

### Q7: Where can I find a lawyer who understands worker cooperatives in Virginia?

Several resources can help:
- [USFWC Service Provider Directory](https://www.usworker.coop/service-provider-directory/) lists cooperative-friendly attorneys
- [Sustainable Economies Law Center](https://www.theselc.org/) provides resources and referrals
- [Greater Washington Center for Employee Ownership](https://www.rochdalecapital.org/gwceo) can provide referrals
- Virginia State Bar Lawyer Referral Service
- Local bar association business law sections

When interviewing attorneys, ask about their experience with cooperative governance, Subchapter T taxation, and Virginia's 2020 worker cooperative statute.

### Q8: Do worker cooperatives qualify for government contracts in Virginia?

Worker cooperatives can pursue government contracts like any other business. Additionally:
- The [Virginia SBSD](https://sbsd.virginia.gov/) offers SWaM certification if your cooperative qualifies as small, women-owned, or minority-owned
- Federal contracting opportunities may be available, particularly in Northern Virginia
- Some jurisdictions have cooperative-friendly procurement policies

The SBDC network can provide government contracting assistance and help with certification processes.
