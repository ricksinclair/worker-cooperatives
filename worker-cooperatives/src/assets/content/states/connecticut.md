# How to Open a Worker Cooperative in Connecticut

A comprehensive guide to forming and operating a worker-owned cooperative business in the State of Connecticut.

---

## 1. Quick Summary

**What makes Connecticut unique for worker cooperatives:**

Connecticut is one of only a handful of states with a **dedicated Worker Cooperative Corporations Act** (Connecticut General Statutes Chapter 599a, Sections 33-418f through 33-418o). This statute provides a clear, purpose-built legal framework specifically designed for worker-owned businesses, making Connecticut an exceptionally favorable state for forming worker cooperatives.

**Key distinguishing features:**

- **Dedicated worker cooperative statute** with comprehensive provisions for membership, voting, patronage allocations, and democratic governance
- Explicit authorization to use **"cooperative" or "co-op" in the corporate name**
- Statutory requirement that **at least 50% of all employees must be members**
- Clear **one-member-one-vote** structure with voting power limited to membership shares
- Active support ecosystem including the **Connecticut Center for Employee Ownership (CTCEO)** and regional organizations like the **Cooperative Development Institute (CDI)**
- Access to **Cooperative Fund of the Northeast (CFNE)** for specialized cooperative financing

**Common entity choices for worker coops in Connecticut:**

1. **Worker Cooperative Corporation** (CGS Chapter 599a) - Purpose-built for worker ownership (recommended)
2. **Limited Liability Company (LLC)** with cooperative operating agreement - Offers flexibility and pass-through taxation
3. **Standard Stock Corporation** with cooperative bylaws - Less common but viable

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Coops in Connecticut

### Option A: Worker Cooperative Corporation (Recommended)

**Statutory Authority:** [Connecticut General Statutes Chapter 599a - Worker Cooperative Corporations](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_599a.htm)

Connecticut's Worker Cooperative Corporations Act provides a comprehensive framework specifically designed for worker-owned businesses. This is the recommended structure for most worker cooperatives in Connecticut.

**Key Statutory Provisions:**

**Definitions (Section 33-418g):**
- **"Worker cooperative"** means a corporation which has elected to be governed by the provisions of Chapter 599a
- **"Member"** means a natural person who has been accepted for membership in, and owns a membership share issued by, a worker cooperative (nonprofits may also be members)
- **"Patronage"** means the amount of work performed as a member of a worker cooperative, measured in accordance with the articles of organization and bylaws

**Election to Become a Worker Cooperative (Section 33-418h):**
- Any corporation formed under Chapter 601 (Connecticut Business Corporation Act) may elect worker cooperative status
- Election is made by stating in the certificate of incorporation or certificate of amendment: *"The corporation elects to be governed as a worker cooperative under Connecticut General Statutes Chapter 599a"*
- Revocation requires a two-thirds vote of members and filing a certificate of amendment
- A worker cooperative **may include the word "cooperative" or "co-op"** in its corporate name

**Membership Requirements (Section 33-418i):**
- Certificate of incorporation or bylaws must establish qualifications and methods for accepting and terminating members
- Members must be either: (1) employed by the cooperative full-time or part-time, OR (2) a nonprofit organization
- **Critical requirement: No less than 50% of all employees must be members**
- The cooperative must issue a class of voting stock designated as **"membership shares"**
- Each member owns **only one membership share**, and only members may own such shares

**Voting Rights (Section 33-418j):**
- **No corporate shares other than membership shares have voting power** (with limited exceptions in the statute)
- Power to amend or repeal bylaws rests with the members only
- Board of directors may amend bylaws only in accordance with Sections 33-806 through 33-808

**Earnings and Losses (Section 33-418l):**
- Net earnings or losses must be apportioned and distributed as specified in the articles or bylaws
- **Patronage allocations** paid or credited to members must be apportioned based on each member's patronage relative to total patronage by all members

**Internal Capital Accounts (Section 33-418m):**
- Statute provides for internal capital accounts to track each member's equity
- Includes provisions for collective reserve accounts for unallocated retained earnings

**Merger Restrictions (Section 33-418o):**
- A worker cooperative **may not merge with a non-worker cooperative corporation**
- Two or more worker cooperatives may consolidate or merge with each other

**Advantages:**
- Purpose-built statutory framework with clear cooperative governance rules
- Explicit legal authority for patronage-based distributions
- Can use "cooperative" or "co-op" in entity name
- Strong member protections and democratic control requirements
- Internal capital account provisions built into statute

**Considerations:**
- Corporate formalities required (annual meetings, minutes, etc.)
- Potential double taxation unless properly structured (consult a tax professional about Subchapter T treatment)
- Must maintain 50% employee membership threshold

**Formation Fees:** $250 total (approximately $100 filing fee + $150 minimum franchise tax/first report)

---

### Option B: LLC with Cooperative Operating Agreement

**Statutory Authority:** [Connecticut General Statutes Title 34 - Limited Liability Companies](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/title_34.htm)

An LLC can be structured to operate as a worker cooperative through a carefully drafted operating agreement. This approach offers flexibility and pass-through taxation.

**Key Operating Agreement Provisions for Cooperative LLCs:**

1. **One-Member-One-Vote:** Connecticut LLC law allows flexible voting structures. The operating agreement should explicitly establish democratic voting regardless of capital contribution.

2. **Patronage-Based Distributions:** The operating agreement can specify that profits are distributed based on labor contribution (patronage) rather than capital investment, consistent with federal Subchapter T requirements for cooperative tax treatment.

3. **Membership Classes:** Define a worker-member class with specific rights, obligations, and procedures for admission and termination.

4. **Capital Accounts:** Establish internal capital account provisions for tracking each member's equity stake.

5. **Buyback Provisions:** Include terms for redeeming member interests upon departure, death, or termination.

**Subchapter T Compliance:**
For LLCs seeking cooperative tax treatment under IRS Subchapter T, the operating agreement should include:
- Subordination of capital (economic benefits and control prioritize labor over capital)
- Democratic control by members
- Allocation of profits proportionally based on patronage
- Patronage distribution requirements (typically 20% minimum in cash within 8.5 months of fiscal year end)

**Advantages:**
- Pass-through taxation (avoids corporate-level double taxation)
- Flexible governance structure
- Less formal requirements than corporations
- Lower ongoing compliance burden
- Can elect Subchapter T treatment for cooperative tax benefits

**Considerations:**
- Cannot use "cooperative" or "co-op" in entity name without potentially confusing the legal status
- Must carefully draft operating agreement to achieve cooperative principles
- No dedicated statutory guidance for cooperative-specific issues
- More reliance on well-drafted internal documents

**Filing Fee:** $120 (Certificate of Organization)

---

### Option C: Standard Stock Corporation with Cooperative Bylaws

**Statutory Authority:** [Connecticut General Statutes Chapter 601 - Connecticut Business Corporation Act](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_601.htm)

A standard Connecticut stock corporation can adopt bylaws that incorporate cooperative principles without formally electing worker cooperative status under Chapter 599a.

**Approach:**
- Form a standard stock corporation
- Draft bylaws and shareholder agreements that establish cooperative governance
- Structure stock ownership to reflect one-member-one-vote principles
- Consider S-Corp election to avoid double taxation (subject to ownership restrictions)

**Advantages:**
- Familiar corporate structure
- S-Corp election available for pass-through taxation (if eligible)
- Flexibility in transitioning to or from cooperative structure

**Considerations:**
- Cannot use "cooperative" or "co-op" in name
- Less legal clarity on cooperative-specific issues
- S-Corp restrictions (100 shareholders max, one class of stock, etc.)
- Requires careful drafting to achieve cooperative principles

**Recommendation:** If forming a worker cooperative in Connecticut, the dedicated Worker Cooperative Corporation statute (Option A) typically provides the clearest legal framework. However, an LLC (Option B) may be preferable for smaller cooperatives seeking simpler administration and pass-through taxation.

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

### Overview

Business conversion to worker ownership offers a succession solution for retiring business owners while preserving jobs, local economic activity, and community ties. Connecticut's strong legal framework and regional support ecosystem make it a favorable state for conversions.

### Two Primary Paths: Worker Cooperative vs. ESOP

| Factor | Worker Cooperative | ESOP |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| **Best For** | Smaller businesses (often under 20 employees) | Larger, consistently profitable businesses (20+ employees) |
| **Setup Costs** | Lower ($10,000-50,000 typical) | Higher ($40,000+ setup, $15-30,000+ annual maintenance) |
| **Governance** | One-member-one-vote; direct democratic control | Typically board-controlled; limited employee voting |
| **Tax Treatment** | Subchapter T (cooperative); patronage deductions | ERISA-qualified retirement plan; significant seller tax benefits |
| **Regulatory Burden** | Lower | Higher (DOL, IRS oversight) |
| **Capital Gains Deferral** | Available for seller | Available for seller (1042 rollover for C-corps) |
| **Retirement Benefit** | Not a retirement plan; separate 401(k) typically needed | Is a retirement plan; shares allocated to employee accounts |

### Connecticut-Specific Considerations

**Legal Framework:**
- Connecticut's Worker Cooperative Corporations Act (Chapter 599a) provides a clear structure for conversions
- Existing corporations can elect worker cooperative status by filing a certificate of amendment

**Support Available:**
- **CTCEO** provides education and service provider referrals for both ESOP and cooperative conversions
- **CDI's Business Ownership Solutions** program has extensive experience facilitating cooperative conversions in New England
- **CFNE** offers conversion financing designed for cooperative transitions

### Typical Conversion Process

1. **Assessment Phase**
   - Business valuation by qualified appraiser
   - Feasibility analysis (financial, workforce, market)
   - Employee interest survey
   - Comparison of ownership structures

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Select legal structure (worker cooperative, ESOP, or hybrid)
   - Negotiate purchase terms with selling owner(s)
   - Develop financing package
   - Draft governing documents

3. **Transaction Phase**
   - Form the cooperative entity (if new) or amend existing entity
   - Secure financing (seller financing, bank loans, CFNE, grants)
   - Execute purchase agreement
   - Transfer ownership

4. **Transition Phase**
   - Employee education on ownership and governance
   - Establish governance structures
   - Implement cooperative management practices
   - Ongoing technical assistance as needed

### Seller Considerations

- Both cooperative and ESOP sales can offer capital gains tax deferral
- Seller financing is common and often necessary for cooperative conversions
- Gradual transitions (seller stays on during transition) are typical
- Consult qualified legal and tax professionals early in the process

## 7. Common Pitfalls in Connecticut

### Legal and Formation Pitfalls

1. **Not Electing Worker Cooperative Status Properly**
   - The certificate of incorporation must explicitly state election to be governed under Chapter 599a
   - Failure to include proper language may result in operating as a standard corporation without cooperative protections

2. **Ignoring the 50% Membership Requirement**
   - Connecticut law requires at least 50% of employees to be members
   - Monitor membership ratios as you hire; non-compliance could jeopardize cooperative status

3. **Merger Restrictions**
   - Worker cooperatives cannot merge with non-cooperative corporations
   - Plan exit strategies and growth paths with this limitation in mind

4. **Inadequate Bylaws or Operating Agreement**
   - Generic templates do not address cooperative-specific needs
   - Invest in properly drafted documents from a cooperative-experienced attorney

### Tax Pitfalls

5. **Missing Subchapter T Requirements**
   - To qualify for cooperative tax treatment, patronage distributions must meet IRS requirements
   - At least 20% of patronage allocations must be paid in cash (or qualified check) within 8.5 months of fiscal year end
   - Work with a CPA experienced in cooperative taxation

6. **Failing to Issue Written Notices of Allocation**
   - Members must receive written notices of patronage allocations
   - Proper documentation is essential for tax compliance

### Governance Pitfalls

7. **Unclear Patronage Calculation**
   - Define exactly how patronage is calculated (hours worked, etc.) in bylaws/operating agreement
   - Ambiguity leads to disputes and potential legal challenges

8. **Inadequate Member Education**
   - Worker-owners need training on cooperative governance, financial literacy, and their rights/responsibilities
   - Allocate time and resources for ongoing education

9. **Probationary Period Issues**
   - Establish clear, fair probationary periods before full membership
   - Document the path to membership and criteria for evaluation

### Financial Pitfalls

10. **Undercapitalization**
    - Worker cooperatives often start with limited capital
    - Plan for adequate working capital and access to credit

11. **No Member Buyout Plan**
    - Without clear redemption policies, departing members may create financial strain
    - Establish reasonable payment terms (often 3-5 years) for member equity redemption

12. **Ignoring Internal Capital Account Management**
    - Track member capital accounts accurately from day one
    - Use accounting software or systems designed for cooperatives if possible

### Compliance Pitfalls

13. **Missing Annual Report Deadlines**
    - LLCs: Annual report due between January 1 and March 31 ($80 fee)
    - Corporations: Annual report due in anniversary month ($150 fee for domestic stock corporations)
    - Late filings can result in penalties and potential administrative dissolution

14. **Forgetting Local Permits**
    - Connecticut has no general state business license, but local requirements vary widely
    - Check with your town/city clerk before operating

## 8. FAQs for Connecticut

### Q1: Does Connecticut have a specific statute for worker cooperatives?

**Yes.** Connecticut is one of only a handful of states with a dedicated worker cooperative statute. The **Worker Cooperative Corporations Act** (Connecticut General Statutes Chapter 599a, Sections 33-418f through 33-418o) provides a comprehensive legal framework specifically for worker-owned businesses. This statute addresses membership requirements, voting rights, patronage allocations, internal capital accounts, and other cooperative-specific matters.

---

### Q2: Can I use "cooperative" or "co-op" in my business name?

**Yes, if you elect worker cooperative status.** Under CGS Section 33-418h, a corporation that has elected to be governed as a worker cooperative under Chapter 599a may include the word "cooperative" or "co-op" in its corporate name. LLCs and standard corporations that have not made this election generally should not use these terms in their names.

---

### Q3: What percentage of employees must be members in a Connecticut worker cooperative?

**At least 50%.** Connecticut General Statutes Section 33-418i requires that "no less than fifty per cent of all employees shall be members." This means you must maintain a membership ratio where at least half of your workforce holds membership shares. Monitor this ratio carefully as you hire non-member employees.

---

### Q4: How much does it cost to form a worker cooperative in Connecticut?

**Approximately $250-$350 for basic formation.** Here is a breakdown of typical costs:

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Certificate of Incorporation (corporation) | ~$100 + franchise tax |
| Certificate of Organization (LLC) | $120 |
| Minimum Franchise Tax (corporations) | ~$150 |
| Name Reservation (optional) | $60 |
| First Report (corporations, within 30 days) | Included in above |
| EIN | Free |
| DRS Tax Registration | Free-$100 (depending on tax types) |

Additional costs include attorney fees for drafting bylaws/operating agreement (highly recommended), accounting setup, and any required local permits.

---

### Q5: What is the difference between a worker cooperative and an ESOP for my Connecticut business?

**Worker cooperatives** are democratic, member-owned businesses where each worker-owner has one vote regardless of their capital contribution. They are governed by cooperative principles and may qualify for Subchapter T tax treatment.

**ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans)** are federally regulated retirement plans that give employees ownership through shares held in trust. ESOPs offer significant tax advantages but have higher setup and maintenance costs, making them typically more suitable for larger, consistently profitable businesses.

In Connecticut, there are approximately 324 employee-owned companies (including ESOPs) but only a handful of worker cooperatives. The **Connecticut Center for Employee Ownership (CTCEO)** provides resources on both models.

---

### Q6: Can an existing Connecticut corporation convert to a worker cooperative?

**Yes.** Under CGS Section 33-418h, any corporation formed under Chapter 601 (Connecticut Business Corporation Act) may elect to be governed as a worker cooperative. The election is made by filing a **Certificate of Amendment** with the Secretary of State that includes a statement electing worker cooperative status under Chapter 599a. You will also need to amend your bylaws to comply with cooperative requirements, issue membership shares, and meet the 50% membership threshold.

---

### Q7: Can a worker cooperative in Connecticut merge with another company?

**Only with other worker cooperatives.** CGS Section 33-418o specifically states that a worker cooperative "may not consolidate or merge with another corporation other than a worker cooperative." Two or more worker cooperatives may merge with each other. This restriction is designed to protect the cooperative's democratic structure and worker ownership. If you anticipate a future sale or merger with a non-cooperative entity, you would need to first revoke the worker cooperative election (requiring a two-thirds member vote).

---
