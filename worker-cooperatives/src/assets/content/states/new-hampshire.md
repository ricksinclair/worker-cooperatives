# How to Open a Worker Cooperative in New Hampshire

A comprehensive guide to forming, operating, and growing a worker-owned cooperative business in the Granite State.

---

## 1. Quick Summary: What Makes New Hampshire Unique

New Hampshire offers a distinctive business environment for worker cooperatives:

**Tax Advantages**
- **No state income tax** on wages or salaries - worker-owners keep more of their earnings
- **No state sales tax** - simplifies retail operations and reduces compliance burden
- **No inventory tax** - beneficial for manufacturing and retail cooperatives
- Business taxation is limited to the [Business Profits Tax (BPT)](https://www.revenue.nh.gov/resource-center/frequently-asked-questions/business-profits-tax) and [Business Enterprise Tax (BET)](https://www.revenue.nh.gov/resource-center/frequently-asked-questions/business-enterprise-tax)

**Business-Friendly Environment**
- Streamlined online business formation through [NH QuickStart](https://quickstart.sos.nh.gov/online/BusinessInquire/)
- Low regulatory burden compared to neighboring states
- Strong small business support infrastructure
- Access to robust New England cooperative networks and financing

**Key Considerations**
- No dedicated worker cooperative statute - most coops form as LLCs or use consumer cooperative statute
- Smaller population means a more limited local market but tight-knit business community
- Proximity to Boston provides access to regional cooperative resources and markets

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives in New Hampshire

New Hampshire does not have a specific worker cooperative statute. Worker cooperatives typically choose one of the following legal structures:

### Option A: Limited Liability Company (LLC) - Most Common Choice

**Why LLCs work well for worker coops:**
- Maximum flexibility to design democratic governance through the [Operating Agreement](https://www.usworker.coop/what-is-a-worker-cooperative/)
- One-member, one-vote principles can be written into governing documents
- Pass-through taxation avoids double taxation
- Limited liability protection for worker-members
- Familiar structure for banks, vendors, and customers

**Key LLC considerations:**
- Operating Agreement must explicitly establish cooperative principles
- Document allocation of profits based on patronage (labor contributed)
- Specify democratic voting procedures
- Define membership requirements and buy-in processes

**Filing:** Certificate of Formation filed with [NH Secretary of State](https://www.sos.nh.gov/corporations-0/forms-and-fees/limited-liability-companies) - $100 fee ($102 online)

### Option B: Consumers' Cooperative Association (RSA 301-A)

New Hampshire's [Consumers' Cooperative Association statute (RSA 301-A)](https://gc.nh.gov/rsa/html/XXVII/301-A/301-A-mrg.htm) can be adapted for worker cooperatives:

**Statutory requirements under RSA 301-A:**
- Five or more persons required (majority must be NH residents)
- One member, one vote (cannot be altered for worker coops)
- Proxy voting prohibited
- Dividends on share capital limited to 10% annually
- Net savings distributed to members based on patronage

**Advantages:**
- Built-in cooperative governance requirements
- Clear statutory framework
- Low filing fee ($5)

**Limitations:**
- Designed primarily for consumer cooperatives
- May require creative adaptation for worker ownership model
- Less flexibility than LLC structure

**Filing:** Certificate of Organization filed with [NH Secretary of State - Consumers' Cooperative Associations](https://sos.nh.gov/corporation-ucc-securities/corporation/forms-and-fees/domestic-and-foreign-miscellaneous-forms/domestic-forms/consumers-cooperative-associations/) - $5 fee

### Option C: Corporation (C-Corp or S-Corp)

Less common but available:
- More rigid governance structure
- Potential double taxation with C-Corp
- S-Corp has ownership restrictions
- May be appropriate for larger cooperatives planning significant outside investment

### Recommendation

**For most worker cooperatives in New Hampshire, the LLC structure offers the best balance of flexibility, simplicity, and protection.** The Operating Agreement can be customized to incorporate cooperative principles while maintaining familiar business practices.

### Governance Best Practices

**Democratic Decision-Making**

- Create systems for member input and feedback

**Board Structure Options**

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for New Hampshire

### Q1: Does New Hampshire have a specific worker cooperative statute?

No. New Hampshire does not have a dedicated worker cooperative statute. Worker cooperatives typically form as LLCs with cooperative provisions in the Operating Agreement, or adapt the [Consumers' Cooperative Association statute (RSA 301-A)](https://gc.nh.gov/rsa/html/XXVII/301-A/301-A-mrg.htm). The LLC structure offers more flexibility and is the most common choice.

### Q2: What are the minimum requirements to form a worker cooperative in New Hampshire?

For an LLC, you need at least one member (though most cooperatives have multiple). The Consumers' Cooperative Association statute requires five or more persons, with a majority being NH residents. You will need a registered agent with a NH address, a distinguishable business name, and the applicable filing fee ($100 for LLC, $5 for cooperative association).

### Q3: How is a worker cooperative taxed in New Hampshire?

Worker cooperatives in NH may be subject to:
- **Business Profits Tax (BPT):** 7.5% on taxable income if gross business income exceeds $103,000
- **Business Enterprise Tax (BET):** 0.55% on enterprise value tax base if gross receipts exceed $281,000 (2024)

BET paid can be credited against BPT. There is no state income tax on wages, and no sales tax. Federally, cooperatives may elect Subchapter T treatment, allowing deduction of patronage dividends distributed to members.

### Q4: How much does it cost to start a worker cooperative in New Hampshire?

Basic formation costs:
- LLC filing fee: $100-$102
- Name reservation (optional): $15
- EIN: Free
- Legal fees for Operating Agreement: $1,500-$5,000 (varies widely)
- Initial capital: Determined by your business plan

Ongoing costs include annual report fees ($100 for LLC) and professional services.

### Q5: Can we convert our existing business to a worker cooperative?

Yes. Business conversions are an excellent pathway to worker ownership. The [Cooperative Development Institute's Business Ownership Solutions program](https://cdi.coop/business-ownership-solutions/) specializes in helping NH businesses transition to worker ownership. The process typically takes 12-24 months and involves business valuation, governance design, financing, and worker-owner training.

- **[Cooperative Fund of the Northeast](https://cooperativefund.org/):** Loans specifically for cooperatives, including products for businesses with limited collateral
- **SBA 7(a) loans:** Available for cooperative businesses through participating lenders
- **Member equity contributions:** Worker-owners invest in their cooperative
- **NH SBDC:** Free business advising and resources

### Q7: Do worker-owners count as employees for workers' compensation and unemployment insurance?

Generally, worker-owners who receive wages or draws are treated as employees for workers' compensation and unemployment insurance purposes in NH. However, treatment can vary based on legal structure and specific circumstances. Consult with an employment attorney or the NH Department of Labor for guidance specific to your situation.

### Q8: Where can I find legal and accounting help familiar with worker cooperatives?
