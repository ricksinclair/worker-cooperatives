# How to Start a Worker Cooperative in Texas

A practical guide to forming and operating a worker-owned cooperative business in the Lone Star State.

---

## 1. Quick Summary: What Makes Texas Unique

Texas offers a distinctive environment for worker cooperatives:

- **No State Income Tax**: Texas is one of only nine states without a personal income tax, meaning worker-owners keep more of their earnings and patronage distributions. This can significantly improve the financial viability of worker cooperatives.

- **Large, Diverse Economy**: As the second-largest state economy in the United States, Texas provides substantial market opportunities across industries including technology, manufacturing, food service, healthcare, green energy, and professional services. Major metropolitan areas like Austin, Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, and San Antonio each have distinct economic ecosystems.

- **Texas Cooperative Association Act**: Cooperatives in Texas are governed by [Chapter 251 of the Texas Business Organizations Code](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BO/htm/BO.251.htm), which provides a dedicated legal framework for cooperative associations. The provisions of Chapter 251 and related sections may be cited as the "Texas Cooperative Association Law."

- **Franchise Tax Exemption**: Cooperative associations organized under Chapter 251 are generally exempt from Texas franchise tax and state license fees under [Tax Code Section 171.075](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/publications/96-1045.php), reducing ongoing compliance costs.

- **Strong Cooperative Ecosystem**: Major cities like Austin and Houston have active cooperative communities, including organizations like [Cooperation Texas](https://community-wealth.org/content/cooperation-texas), the [Austin Cooperative Business Association (ACBA)](https://acba.coop/), and [We Are The Ones](https://www.wearetheoneshtx.org/) in Houston.

- **Protected Naming**: Only entities organized as cooperatives under Texas law may use the term "cooperative" or "co-op" in their business name, protecting the cooperative identity. Violation is a misdemeanor offense.

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives

Texas offers two primary legal structures for worker cooperatives. Each has distinct advantages depending on your cooperative's goals.

### Option A: Cooperative Association (Chapter 251)

The [Texas Business Organizations Code Chapter 251](https://texas.public.law/statutes/tex._bus._orgs._code_title_6_chapter_251) provides a dedicated cooperative structure.

**Key Features:**
- Specifically designed for cooperative enterprises
- Franchise tax exemption for qualifying cooperatives
- Protected use of "cooperative" or "co-op" in business name (required)
- One-member, one-vote governance required by statute
- Lower filing fees ($25 for certificate of formation)
- Minimum of five directors required, elected by and from members
- Board terms may not exceed three years
- Provisions of [Chapters 20 and 22](https://www.sos.state.tx.us/corp/boc.shtml) (nonprofit corporation rules) apply where Chapter 251 does not conflict

**Board Requirements:**
- Minimum of five directors
- Directors must be elected by and from the cooperative's members
- Directors serve terms not exceeding three years as provided by bylaws
- Board annually elects president, vice president(s), secretary, and treasurer (secretary and treasurer may be combined)

**Membership:**
- Certificate of formation or bylaws establish membership qualifications
- Individuals, unincorporated groups organized on a cooperative basis, or nonprofit groups may be eligible for membership
- Members may not vote by proxy but may vote by mail or delegates if bylaws permit

**Best For:**
- Cooperatives that want explicit cooperative identity and legal recognition
- Organizations prioritizing democratic governance protected by statute
- Groups seeking franchise tax benefits
- Cooperatives that may seek recognition from cooperative organizations

**Considerations:**
- Requires minimum of five board members (challenging for small startups)
- At least 50% of business must be conducted with members
- More prescriptive governance requirements than LLCs

### Option B: Limited Liability Company (LLC) with Cooperative Operating Agreement

Texas allows LLCs to be structured with cooperative principles through a carefully drafted operating agreement.

**Key Features:**
- Greater flexibility in governance and financial arrangements
- No minimum board size or member requirement
- Can incorporate one-member, one-vote provisions in operating agreement
- Can elect Subchapter T tax treatment by filing as a corporation
- May be easier to form with a smaller initial group
- Cannot use "cooperative" or "co-op" in business name under Texas law
- Filing fee: $300

**Best For:**
- Smaller groups with fewer than five founding members
- Cooperatives seeking maximum structural flexibility
- Businesses that may need to attract outside investment
- Groups prioritizing operational simplicity

**Considerations:**
- Cannot use protected "cooperative" naming
- May not qualify for cooperative-specific tax exemptions
- Requires careful drafting to prevent future erosion of cooperative principles
- May not be recognized by some cooperative organizations

**Resources for LLC Worker Cooperatives:**
- [Democracy at Work Institute Template Operating Agreement](https://institute.coop/topics/articles-incorporation-bylaws-operating-agreements) for worker cooperative LLCs
- [Sustainable Economies Law Center guidance](https://www.theselc.org/worker-coop-academy) on LLC vs. cooperative corporation

**Tax Classification Note:** Regardless of state structure, worker cooperatives seeking to use IRS [Subchapter T](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-A/chapter-1/subchapter-T) tax treatment (which allows deduction of patronage dividends) must be taxed as corporations at the federal level. An LLC can elect corporate tax treatment to access these benefits by filing Form 8832.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Cooperative Association | LLC |
|---------|------------------------|-----|
| Filing Fee | $25 | $300 |
| Can Use "Co-op" Name | Required | Prohibited |
| Franchise Tax Exempt | Generally Yes | No (unless below $2.47M threshold) |
| Minimum Directors | 5 | None |
| Governance Flexibility | Limited by statute | High |
| Federal Subchapter T | Yes (as corporation) | Yes (with election) |
| Bank/Vendor Familiarity | Less common | Very common |

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

Converting an existing business to worker ownership can preserve jobs, build community wealth, and provide business owners with a succession plan.

### Why Consider Conversion?

- Over 4 million U.S. businesses owned by retiring baby boomers will change hands in the next decade
- More than half of small business owners lack succession plans
- Worker cooperatives preserve jobs and institutional knowledge
- Owners can receive fair market value while ensuring business continuity
- 90% of worker cooperatives sustain operations beyond 5 years

### Conversion Readiness Assessment

Before pursuing conversion, evaluate:

**Financial Health:**
- Minimal existing debt
- Strong financial health over past 5 years
- Positive future business forecast
- Stable revenue streams

**Workforce Factors:**
- Employees interested in ownership
- Existing collaborative culture
- Capable management team
- Workers willing to invest in buy-in

**Owner Readiness:**
- Clear succession timeline
- Willingness to transition over time (often 6 months to several years)
- Realistic valuation expectations
- Commitment to worker ownership values

### Conversion Pathways

**Direct Sale to Worker Cooperative**
- Workers form a cooperative and purchase the business
- May use combination of member equity, seller financing, and loans
- Seller can structure deal for tax benefits
- Maintains democratic worker control from day one
- Less complex to set up and maintain than ESOPs

**Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)**
- Retirement plan that invests in company stock
- Significant tax benefits (100% ESOP-owned S-corps pay no federal income tax on profits)
- Over 324 employee-owned companies in Texas
- Requires professional administration

**Employee Ownership Trust (EOT)**
- Business owned by perpetual trust for employees' benefit
- Profits above reinvestment needs go to employees
- Less expensive than ESOP to create and administer
- Lacks some ESOP tax benefits

### Texas Resources for Conversions

- [Texas Center for Employee Ownership (TXCEO)](https://www.txceo.org/) - Education and service provider connections
- [Cooperation Texas](https://community-wealth.org/content/cooperation-texas) - Cooperative development assistance
- [DAWI Conversion Resources](https://institute.coop/tools/for-worker-coops/conversions) - National tools and case studies
- [Project Equity](https://project-equity.org/) - Conversion-focused national organization
- [Becoming Employee Owned - Texas](https://becomingemployeeowned.org/place/texas/) - State-specific resources

### Steps for Conversion

1. **Exploration**: Owner learns about employee ownership options; assess fit
2. **Feasibility Study**: Business valuation, financial modeling, employee interest assessment
3. **Structure Selection**: Choose between cooperative, ESOP, or EOT
4. **Transaction Planning**: Develop timeline, structure purchase terms, create financing plan
5. **Legal Documentation**: Draft purchase agreement, governing documents
6. **Employee Education**: Train workers on ownership responsibilities
7. **Transition**: Execute purchase and begin democratic governance
8. **Ongoing Support**: Continue training and technical assistance

### Financing Conversions

Common financing structures include:
- **Seller Financing**: Owner carries note, paid from business cash flow
- **Member Equity**: Workers purchase membership shares
- **Bank Financing**: SBA loans, particularly 7(a) program
- **Combination**: Multiple sources often required

The **Main Street Employee Ownership Act** (2018) improved SBA lending for conversions to worker cooperatives.

## 7. Common Pitfalls in Texas

### Legal and Formation Pitfalls

**1. Using "Cooperative" Without Proper Formation**

Under [BOC Section 251.451](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BO/htm/BO.251.htm), only entities organized under Chapter 251 may use "cooperative" in their name. Violation is a misdemeanor with fines of $25-$200 per month.

**2. Insufficient Board Size for Cooperative Associations**

Chapter 251 requires a minimum of five directors elected by and from members. Starting with fewer directors or having non-member directors violates the statute.

**3. Name Conflicts**

Always conduct thorough name search before filing. Names must be "distinguishable" from existing registered entities - similar (not just identical) names are prohibited.

**4. Inadequate Governing Documents**

Generic templates may not protect cooperative principles. Invest in proper legal review of bylaws/operating agreement. Address amendment procedures to prevent future erosion of cooperative structure.

**5. Skipping the Organization Meeting**

Required by law after certificate of formation is filed. Document all proceedings in minutes. Formally adopt bylaws and elect officers.

### Compliance Failures

**6. Registered Agent Lapses**

Must maintain registered agent continuously. Update Secretary of State if agent changes ($5 for cooperatives). Failure can result in involuntary termination.

**7. Missing Franchise Tax Exemption Filing**

Cooperative associations must apply for franchise tax exemption with the Comptroller using [Form AP-204](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/exempt/). The exemption is not automatic.

**8. Not Filing Certificate of Amendment Timely**

Amendments must be filed within 30 days of member adoption. Late filing can create compliance issues.

**9. Missing Annual Reports**

Even exempt cooperatives should confirm exemption status. Public Information Reports may still be due annually.

### Operational Challenges

**10. Ignoring the 50% Rule**

Cooperative associations must conduct at least 50% of business with members. Plan business model accordingly and document member versus non-member transactions.

**11. Conflating Ownership and Day-to-Day Management**

Just because everyone owns the business doesn't mean every decision requires a vote. Clear delegation of authority creates efficiency.

**12. Inadequate Member Education**

Worker-owners need training in governance and business operations. Budget for ongoing education. Develop onboarding processes for new members.

**13. Poor Capital Planning**

Establish clear member buy-in requirements. Create capital retention policies. Plan for member departures and capital redemption.

### Financial Pitfalls

**14. Misunderstanding Patronage vs. Wages**

Distinguish between:
- Wages (compensation for labor, subject to employment tax)
- Patronage distributions (share of surplus based on work contribution)

**15. Missing Federal Tax Requirements**

For Subchapter T benefits, patronage dividends must be distributed within 8.5 months of fiscal year end. Maintain proper documentation. File Form 1099-PATR for distributions of $10 or more.

**16. Assuming All Cooperatives Are Tax-Exempt**

Not all cooperative structures qualify for franchise tax exemption. LLCs operating as cooperatives are generally NOT exempt unless they meet the no-tax-due threshold ($2.47M revenue).

### Texas-Specific Considerations

**17. Overlooking Local Requirements**

Texas has strong local government authority. Business licensing, permitting, and regulations vary significantly by city and county.

**18. Commingling Finances**

Establish separate business bank accounts immediately. Maintain clear separation between personal and business funds. Keep accurate financial records.

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q1: What is the minimum number of people needed to start a worker cooperative in Texas?

For a **Cooperative Association** under Chapter 251, you need at least five people to serve as initial directors. The directors must be elected from the cooperative's members. For an **LLC** structured as a worker cooperative, there is no statutory minimum - you could theoretically start with one person, though the cooperative model works best with multiple worker-owners sharing democratic governance.

### Q2: How much does it cost to form a worker cooperative in Texas?

**Cooperative Association (Chapter 251):**
- Certificate of formation filing: $25
- Name reservation (optional): $40
- Registered agent consent: $5
- **Total minimum: approximately $25-$70**

**LLC:**
- Certificate of formation filing: $300
- Name reservation (optional): $40
- **Total minimum: approximately $300-$340**

Additional costs may include:
- Attorney fees for document preparation: $500-$5,000+
- Registered agent service: $100-$300/year (if using professional service)
- Business licenses and permits: varies by location and industry

### Q3: Are worker cooperatives in Texas exempt from franchise tax?

**Cooperative associations** organized under Chapter 251 are generally exempt from Texas franchise tax under [Tax Code Section 171.075](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/publications/96-1045.php). However, this exemption is not automatic - you must apply with the Comptroller using Form AP-204.

**LLCs structured as cooperatives** do not automatically receive this exemption and must comply with standard franchise tax requirements unless revenues fall below the no-tax-due threshold of $2,470,000.

All cooperatives remain subject to:
- Sales tax (if selling taxable goods or services)
- Unemployment insurance tax (if paying wages)
- Federal taxes (though Subchapter T provides special treatment)

### Q4: Can an LLC use "cooperative" or "co-op" in its name in Texas?

**No.** Under [BOC Section 251.451](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BO/htm/BO.251.htm), only cooperative associations governed by Chapter 251 (or foreign entities operating on a cooperative basis and authorized to do business in Texas) may use "cooperative" or any abbreviation in their business name. Violation is a misdemeanor offense with fines of $25-$200 per month.

An LLC can still **operate** according to cooperative principles but cannot use "cooperative" in its legal name.

### Q5: How are profits distributed in a Texas worker cooperative?

Worker cooperatives typically distribute surplus (profits) as **patronage dividends** based on each member's contribution to the cooperative - usually measured by hours worked, wages earned, or some combination. This differs from traditional corporations where profits are distributed based on share ownership.

The specific formula must be established in your bylaws or operating agreement. For federal tax benefits under [Subchapter T](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-A/chapter-1/subchapter-T), patronage dividends must be distributed within 8.5 months after the fiscal year ends and reported on Form 1099-PATR for amounts of $10 or more.

### Q6: What resources exist specifically for starting a worker cooperative in Texas?

Texas has several organizations dedicated to cooperative development:

- **[Cooperation Texas](https://community-wealth.org/content/cooperation-texas)** (Austin): 50+ hours of training through the Cooperative Business Institute
- **[Austin Cooperative Business Association](https://acba.coop/)**: Free coaching, events, advocacy

- **[Texas SBDC Network](https://txsbdc.org/)**: Free business counseling statewide
- **[Texas Center for Employee Ownership](https://www.txceo.org/)**: Employee ownership education and resources

### Q7: How long does it take to form a worker cooperative in Texas?

**Formation timeline:**
