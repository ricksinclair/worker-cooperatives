# How to Start a Worker Cooperative in Oregon

## Quick Summary

Oregon stands out as one of the most cooperative-friendly states in the nation, with a deeply rooted culture of collaboration and workplace democracy. The state benefits from:

- **Dedicated Cooperative Statute**: The [Oregon Cooperative Corporation Act (ORS Chapter 62)](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors062.html) provides a clear legal framework specifically designed for cooperative businesses, established in 1957 and regularly updated. This statute allows cooperatives to be organized for any lawful purpose except banking or insurance.

- **Thriving Cooperative Ecosystem**: Portland, in particular, has earned recognition as a hub for worker-owned businesses. The city is home to iconic cooperatives like [People's Food Co-op](https://www.peoples.coop/) (founded 1970), [Alberta Cooperative Grocery](https://alberta.coop/), and [Citybikes Workers' Cooperative](https://portlandwiki.org/Worker-Owned_Cooperatives).

- **Strong Regional Support Infrastructure**: Oregon is served by the [Northwest Cooperative Development Center (NWCDC)](https://nwcdc.coop/), founded in 1979, one of the oldest and most established cooperative development organizations in the country. NWCDC provides comprehensive services from business planning to financing.

- **Progressive Business Culture**: Oregon's entrepreneurial ecosystem has embraced alternative business models, with successful worker cooperatives operating across diverse sectors including food service, landscaping, manufacturing, technology, and hospitality.

- **Notable Success Stories**: Oregon is home to influential worker cooperatives including [People's Food Co-op](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Food_Co-op) (Portland, since 1970 with 3,000+ member-owners), [Blue Scorcher Bakery and Cafe](https://www.oregonhumanities.org/rll/magazine/green-winter-2024/buying-in/) (Astoria), [Mirisata](https://www.pdxmonthly.com/eat-and-drink/2021/03/restaurants-in-portland-and-beyond-look-to-cooperative-ownership-models-during-the-pandemic) (Portland vegan Sri Lankan restaurant), and Breitenbush Hot Springs (Detroit, Oregon).

## Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives in Oregon

Oregon offers two primary legal structures for worker cooperatives, each with distinct advantages:

### Option 1: Cooperative Corporation (ORS Chapter 62)

The [Oregon Cooperative Corporation Act](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_chapter_62) provides a purpose-built legal structure for cooperatives. According to [ORS 62.005](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_62.005), this chapter may be cited as the Oregon Cooperative Corporation Act.

**Advantages:**
- **Cooperative Identity**: May use "cooperative" or "co-op" in your business name (LLCs are [prohibited from using these terms](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors063.html))
- **Subchapter T Eligibility**: Automatically qualifies for [federal cooperative tax treatment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-A/chapter-1/subchapter-T), allowing patronage dividends to be deducted from taxable income
- **General Powers**: Under [ORS 62.125](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_62.125), cooperatives have power to exercise all powers necessary or convenient to effect any or all of the purposes for which the cooperative is organized
- **Securities Law Benefits**: May qualify for cooperative-specific exemptions for member investments
- **Limited Liability**: Per [ORS 62.175](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_62.175), no member or shareholder is liable for the acts or debts of the cooperative beyond unpaid subscription amounts
- **Established Precedent**: Oregon's cooperative law has been in place since 1957, providing legal clarity

**Key Statutory Features:**
- Cooperatives may be organized for any lawful purpose except banking or insurance
- Membership is conditioned on ownership of membership stock or payment of a membership fee as set forth in the articles
- One-member, one-vote democratic governance structure (with limited exceptions under [ORS 62.265](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_62.265))
- Board of directors exercises corporate powers under [ORS 62.280](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_62.280)
- Annual report filing required with Secretary of State

**Best For:** Worker cooperatives seeking clear cooperative identity, those planning to raise member investments, businesses wanting Subchapter T tax treatment, and co-ops with community-facing missions.

### Option 2: Limited Liability Company (LLC) with Cooperative Operating Agreement

Oregon LLCs, governed by [ORS Chapter 63](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors063.html), offer flexibility that can accommodate cooperative principles:

**Advantages:**
- **Structural Flexibility**: Under [ORS 63.431](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_63.431), the operating agreement can establish democratic governance and profit-sharing based on labor
- **Familiar Structure**: Attorneys, accountants, and banks are generally more familiar with LLCs
- **Default Pass-Through Taxation**: Profits and losses pass through to members without entity-level taxation
- **Lower Compliance Burden**: May have simpler ongoing filing requirements
- **Customizable Rules**: Oregon law allows operating agreements to create any rules not inconsistent with law or the Articles of Organization

**Limitations:**
- **Cannot use "cooperative" in name**: Oregon law explicitly prohibits LLCs from using terms like "cooperative," "corporation," "corp.," or "incorporated"
- **Subchapter T Uncertainty**: May not automatically qualify for cooperative tax treatment unless electing corporate taxation
- **Securities Considerations**: Passive investors in LLCs generally face more securities law requirements
- **Less Legal Clarity**: Must rely on operating agreement rather than cooperative-specific statute

**Best For:** Smaller worker cooperatives, professional service firms, businesses seeking simplicity, and co-ops where all members will be actively involved in management.

### Comparison Summary

| Feature | Cooperative Corporation | LLC |
|---------|------------------------|-----|
| Use "Cooperative" in Name | Yes | No |
| Subchapter T Tax Treatment | Yes | Conditional |
| Formation Fee | $100 | $100 |
| Annual Report Fee | $100 | $100 |
| Governance Flexibility | Moderate | High |
| Professional Familiarity | Lower | Higher |

### Recommendation

For most worker cooperatives in Oregon, the **Cooperative Corporation** structure is recommended because:
1. Oregon has well-developed cooperative corporation law with clear statutory guidance
2. Subchapter T tax treatment provides significant benefits
3. The cooperative identity strengthens member commitment and community recognition
4. The [NWCDC](https://nwcdc.coop/) has extensive experience supporting this structure

Consult with an attorney familiar with cooperative business structures to determine the best fit for your specific situation.

## Worker-Ownership Conversions

Oregon has a growing track record of successful business conversions to worker cooperatives, making it an excellent state for this ownership transition strategy. The [NWCDC](https://nwcdc.coop/sectors/worker/) has extensive experience supporting conversions throughout the Pacific Northwest.

### Why Consider Conversion in Oregon?

- **Established Legal Framework**: [ORS Chapter 62](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors062.html) provides clear cooperative corporation structure
- **Regional Expertise**: NWCDC offers [business-to-cooperative conversion support](https://nwcdc.coop/sectors/worker/) at all stages from feasibility to close of sale to worker-owners, plus ongoing support
- **Tax Benefits**: Selling to employees through a cooperative can qualify for the same [Section 1042 rollover](https://institute.coop/resources/selling-your-business-your-employees-employee-stock-ownership-plans-esop-worker-owned) tax benefits as an ESOP
- **Baby Boomer Succession**: Many Oregon small businesses face ownership transitions as founders retire
- **Community Values Alignment**: Oregon's progressive business culture supports worker ownership
- **Legacy Preservation**: A sale to employees can create a buyer for a profitable company while preserving its culture

### Cooperative vs. ESOP: Key Differences

According to [Democracy at Work Institute research](https://institute.coop/resources/selling-your-business-your-employees-employee-stock-ownership-plans-esop-worker-owned):

| Factor | Worker Cooperative | ESOP |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| **Regulation** | Not a retirement plan, less regulated | Qualified retirement plan, highly regulated |
| **Setup/Maintenance Cost** | Lower | Higher |
| **Ideal Size** | Smaller companies, under 20-25 employees | Larger, profitable, capital-intensive companies |
| **Tax Advantages** | Smaller but significant | Larger |
| **Section 1042 Rollover** | Yes, if C-corp sells 30%+ to qualified worker cooperative | Yes, if C-corp sells 30%+ to ESOP |
| **Governance** | One member, one vote; direct democracy | Shares held in trust; voting varies |
| **Best For** | Companies where employees plan to acquire all stock over time | Profitable, growing companies |

## Common Pitfalls in Oregon

### Legal and Formation Pitfalls

#### 1. Choosing the Wrong Entity Structure
**Problem**: Forming as an LLC when cooperative corporation would better serve your needs, or vice versa.

**Consequences**:
- May lose ability to use "cooperative" in name (LLCs prohibited)
- Potential loss of Subchapter T tax benefits
- Securities law complications with investor members
- Misalignment with cooperative identity

**Prevention**:
- Consult with cooperative-experienced attorney before filing
- Contact [NWCDC](https://nwcdc.coop/) for structure guidance
- Consider long-term financing and growth plans
- Review both [ORS Chapter 62](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors062.html) and [Chapter 63](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors063.html)

#### 2. Inadequate Bylaws or Operating Agreement
**Problem**: Using generic templates without cooperative-specific provisions or failing to address critical issues.

**Consequences**:
- Governance conflicts with no clear resolution
- Member departure disputes
- Patronage calculation disagreements
- Potential loss of Subchapter T status

**Prevention**:
- Use cooperative-specific templates from [USFWC](https://www.usworker.coop/resources/) or NWCDC
- Address member buyout terms explicitly
- Document patronage calculation methodology per [ORS 62.415](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_62.415)
- Include dispute resolution procedures
- Have cooperative attorney review documents

#### 3. Overlooking Portland/Local License Requirements
**Problem**: Registering with the state but neglecting local business licenses and taxes.

**Consequences**:
- Penalties and back taxes owed
- Compliance violations
- Professional license issues

**Prevention**:
- Register with [Portland Revenue Division](https://www.portland.gov/revenue/register-tax-account) if doing business in Portland
- Check requirements in your specific city/county (requirements vary widely)
- Use [Business Xpress License Directory](https://apps.oregon.gov/sos/licensedirectory/) for state licenses
- Consult with local SBDC

### Financial and Tax Pitfalls

#### 4. Misunderstanding Subchapter T Requirements
**Problem**: Claiming cooperative tax treatment without meeting IRS requirements.

**Consequences**:
- Back taxes, penalties, and interest
- Loss of tax-deferred status on patronage allocations
- Audit risks

**Prevention**:
- Ensure you operate on a cooperative basis (subordination of capital, democratic control, patronage-based distribution)
- Distribute or allocate patronage based on work performed, not capital invested
- Maintain proper documentation of patronage calculations
- Work with accountant experienced in cooperative taxation
- Issue Forms 1099-PATR correctly

#### 5. Inadequate Capitalization
**Problem**: Starting with insufficient capital or relying too heavily on debt.

**Consequences**:
- Cash flow crises
- Inability to meet payroll
- Member dissatisfaction with no distributions
- Business failure

**Prevention**:
- Require meaningful member capital contributions
- Build adequate reserves before distributing patronage
- Develop realistic financial projections
- Secure lines of credit for working capital
- Consider patient capital from [Shared Capital Cooperative](https://sharedcapital.coop/) (no personal guarantees)

#### 6. Ignoring Member Capital Account Management
**Problem**: Failing to track individual member capital accounts accurately.

**Consequences**:
- Tax compliance issues
- Disputes when members depart
- Difficulty calculating buyout amounts
- Accounting nightmares

**Prevention**:
- Set up proper capital account tracking from day one
- Use accounting software that handles capital accounts
- Document all allocations and distributions
- Provide annual capital account statements to members

### Governance Pitfalls

#### 7. Inadequate Member Education and Onboarding
**Problem**: Bringing in new worker-owners without proper training in cooperative principles and governance.

**Consequences**:
- Members unclear on rights and responsibilities
- Poor participation in governance
- Cultural drift away from cooperative values
- Conflicts over decision-making

**Prevention**:
- Implement thorough candidacy period (6-12 months common)
- Require cooperative education before full membership
- Provide ongoing governance training

#### 8. Consensus Paralysis
**Problem**: Requiring consensus for all decisions, leading to gridlock.

**Consequences**:
- Slow decision-making
- Frustration among members
- Inability to respond to business needs
- Meeting fatigue

**Prevention**:
- Reserve consensus for major decisions only
- Use consent-based decision-making (sociocracy model, like Blue Scorcher)
- Clearly define which decisions require member vote vs. board vs. management

- Set decision-making timelines

#### 9. Founder Dominance
**Problem**: Founding members retaining too much control, undermining democratic principles.

**Consequences**:

- Consider registered agent service for reminders

### Market and Strategy Pitfalls

#### 12. Underestimating Competition
**Problem**: Assuming cooperative model alone will attract customers without competitive products/services.

**Consequences**:
- Insufficient revenue
- Financial distress
- Member compensation below market
- Business failure

**Prevention**:
- Conduct thorough market research
- Focus on product/service quality first
- Develop clear competitive advantages
- Market the cooperative difference strategically
- Work with [Oregon SBDC](https://oregonsbdc.org/) on business planning

## FAQs for Oregon

### 1. How many people do I need to start a worker cooperative in Oregon?

**For a Cooperative Corporation**: Oregon law under [ORS 62.280](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_62.280) requires a minimum of **three directors** for a cooperative corporation, though if the cooperative has fewer than three members, the number of directors cannot be less than the number of members. Per [ORS 62.511](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_62.511), one or more individuals 18 years of age or older may act as incorporators.

**For an LLC**: Oregon has no minimum member requirement for LLCs. However, operating as a meaningful cooperative typically requires at least 2-3 worker-members to have democratic governance.

**Practical Considerations**: Starting with too few members concentrates risk and workload. Starting with too many can complicate initial decision-making. Most cooperative developers recommend 3-7 committed founders for a startup worker cooperative.

### 2. What are the costs to form and maintain a worker cooperative in Oregon?

**Formation Costs (Minimum)**:
| Item | Cooperative Corporation | LLC |
|------|------------------------|-----|
| Filing Fee | $100 | $100 |
| Name Reservation (optional) | $50 | $50 |
| Registered Agent (if using service) | $50-$300/year | $50-$300/year |
| EIN | Free | Free |
| **Minimum Total** | **$100-$150** | **$100-$150** |

**Additional Recommended Costs**:
- Legal review of documents: $1,000-$5,000
- Accounting setup: $500-$2,000
- Business planning assistance: $0 ([Oregon SBDC](https://oregonsbdc.org/) is free) to $5,000+

**Annual Maintenance**:
- Annual Report: $100 (both cooperative and LLC per current fee schedule)
- Registered agent service: $50-$300
- Accounting/tax preparation: $500-$3,000+
- Portland Business License Tax: Based on net income (minimum $100)

### 3. What's the difference between forming as a cooperative corporation vs. an LLC in Oregon?

| Factor | Cooperative Corporation | LLC |
|--------|------------------------|-----|
| **Governing Law** | [ORS Chapter 62](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors062.html) | [ORS Chapter 63](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors063.html) |
| **"Cooperative" in Name** | Yes | No (prohibited) |
| **Subchapter T Tax Treatment** | Automatic eligibility | Must elect corporate taxation |
| **Formation Complexity** | Moderate | Simpler |
| **Annual Report Fee** | $100 | $100 |
| **Governance Rules** | Defined in statute | Defined in operating agreement |
| **Securities Treatment** | Cooperative exemptions may apply | Standard securities rules |
| **Professional Familiarity** | Lower | Higher |

**Recommendation**: For most worker cooperatives, the cooperative corporation structure is preferred because it provides clear legal identity, Subchapter T tax benefits, and better alignment with cooperative principles. Consult with a cooperative attorney to determine the best fit for your situation.

### 4. How does taxation work for worker cooperatives in Oregon?

**Federal Taxation (Subchapter T)**:
Worker cooperatives organized as cooperative corporations (or LLCs electing corporate taxation) can benefit from [Subchapter T](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-A/chapter-1/subchapter-T) of the Internal Revenue Code:

- The cooperative can **deduct patronage dividends** distributed or allocated to members
- Patronage must be allocated based on work performed, not capital invested
- Members pay tax on patronage dividends they receive (or have allocated in writing)
- This creates **single taxation** (at the member level) rather than double taxation

**Oregon State Taxes**:
- Oregon does not have a general sales tax
- **Corporate Excise Tax**: Applies to corporations doing business in Oregon
- **Corporate Activity Tax (CAT)**: Applies if Oregon commercial activity exceeds $750,000
- **Pass-through taxation**: LLCs not electing corporate status pass income to members

**Payroll Taxes (via [Combined Employer Registration](https://www.oregon.gov/dor/programs/businesses/pages/withholding-and-payroll-tax.aspx))**:
- Oregon withholding tax
- Unemployment insurance (Oregon Employment Department)
- Workers' Benefit Fund assessment
- Transit taxes (TriMet for Portland metro, Lane Transit for Eugene/Springfield)
- Paid Leave Oregon (automatically included)

**Important**: Work with an accountant experienced in cooperative taxation to ensure compliance and optimize tax treatment.

### 5. Do we need a lawyer to form a worker cooperative in Oregon?

**Legally Required**: No, Oregon does not require an attorney to form a business entity.

**Strongly Recommended**: Yes, for several reasons:

- **Cooperative-Specific Issues**: Generic business formation services may not understand cooperative structures, patronage allocation, or member capital accounts
- **Bylaws Complexity**: Worker cooperative bylaws involve issues not present in traditional businesses
- **Tax Implications**: Subchapter T compliance requires careful structuring
- **Employment Law**: Worker-owners have a dual relationship with the cooperative
- **Securities Considerations**: Member equity investments may implicate securities laws

**Cost-Effective Alternatives**:
- Use [NWCDC](https://nwcdc.coop/) for cooperative-specific guidance (may be free or low-cost)
- Obtain [USFWC](https://www.usworker.coop/resources/) template documents for starting framework
- Have attorney review (rather than draft) documents
- Use Oregon State Bar Lawyer Referral Service for initial consultation

### 6. What resources are available specifically for Oregon worker cooperatives?

**Primary Resources**:

1. **[Northwest Cooperative Development Center (NWCDC)](https://nwcdc.coop/)**: Regional cooperative development organization serving Oregon since 1979. Offers consulting, training, financing (no personal guarantees), and conversion support. Phone: 360-943-4241.

### 7. How do members share profits in an Oregon worker cooperative?

Worker cooperatives distribute profits (called **patronage**) based on work performed, not capital invested, per [ORS 62.415](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_62.415). Here's how it typically works:

**Patronage Calculation Methods**:
- **Hours worked**: Most straightforward method
- **Compensation earned**: Proportional to wages/draws received
- **Equal shares**: If all members contribute similarly
- **Combination**: May weight multiple factors

**Distribution Process**:
1. At fiscal year-end, calculate net income available for distribution
2. Allocate patronage to each member based on chosen method
3. Decide how much to distribute in cash vs. retain in the cooperative
4. For Subchapter T: Must distribute at least 20% in cash (or meet other requirements)
5. Issue allocation notices and 1099-PATR forms

**Capital Retention**:
- Many cooperatives retain 50-80% of patronage as retained capital
- Retained patronage is credited to member capital accounts
- Paid out when member leaves or on a revolving schedule (e.g., after 5-7 years)

**Oregon Legal Requirements**:
- [ORS 62.175](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_62.175) governs capital stock and membership stock
- [ORS 62.415](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_62.415) addresses apportionment and distribution
- Bylaws should clearly define patronage allocation and distribution policies

### 8. What happens when a worker-owner leaves the cooperative?

Member departure involves several considerations:

**Types of Departure**:
- Voluntary resignation
- Retirement
- Involuntary termination (for cause)
- Death or incapacity

**Financial Obligations**:
1. **Capital Account Payout**: The departing member is entitled to their capital account balance, which includes:
   - Initial capital contribution
   - Allocated but unpaid patronage
   - Any interest (if bylaws provide)

2. **Payout Timeline**: Bylaws should specify when and how capital accounts are paid out:
   - Immediate payment (may strain cooperative finances)
   - Installment payments over 1-5 years (most common)
   - Deferred until cooperative has sufficient funds

3. **Adjustments**: Bylaws may provide for:
   - Withholding for amounts owed to cooperative
   - Reduction if cooperative has losses
   - Discount for early redemption

**Employment Transition**:
- Determine final pay, accrued benefits
- Handle any non-compete or confidentiality obligations
- Complete required employment documentation
- Provide COBRA information (if applicable)

**Best Practices**:
- Document departure procedures in bylaws and member agreements
- Maintain adequate reserves for anticipated buyouts
- Consider "rolling" capital redemption schedules
- Address departure terms during onboarding to set expectations
