# How to Open a Worker Cooperative in Vermont

Vermont stands as a national leader in worker ownership, making it one of the most supportive states for forming a worker cooperative. This guide walks you through the legal structures, formation steps, funding resources, and practical considerations for launching your worker cooperative in the Green Mountain State.

---

## 1. Quick Summary: What Makes Vermont Unique

Vermont has **more worker cooperatives per capita than any other U.S. state**, with approximately 3.26 worker cooperatives per 100,000 residents. With around 20 worker cooperatives and approximately 40 entirely employee-owned companies, the state's cooperative tradition runs deep, supported by robust infrastructure and a culture that values local ownership and democratic enterprise.

**Key advantages of forming a worker cooperative in Vermont:**

- **Dedicated Worker Cooperative Corporation Statute**: [11 V.S.A. Chapter 8](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/chapter/11/008) provides a clear, comprehensive legal framework specifically designed for worker-owned businesses, enacted in 1985.

- **Vermont Employee Ownership Center (VEOC)**: Established in 2001, this statewide nonprofit provides free technical assistance, educational resources, succession planning seminars, and direct support for cooperative formation and conversions. VEOC also administers a dedicated [loan fund](https://veoc.org/loanfund) for employee ownership transitions.

- **State legislative support**: Vermont's legislature has adopted a formal position favoring employee ownership, with reliable state funding appropriations dedicated to cooperative development.

- **Strong regional financing ecosystem**: Access to the [Cooperative Fund of the Northeast](https://cooperativefund.org/) (CDFI with over $68 million deployed), the Vermont Employee Ownership Loan Fund, and cooperative-friendly lenders.

- **Proven track record**: Successful conversions including Green Mountain Spinnery (2006), New School of Montpelier (2015), and Covered Bridge Cookies (2023) demonstrate Vermont's effective support system.

- **Network effect**: Existing cooperatives welcome mentorship opportunities, and organizations like the [Valley Alliance of Worker Cooperatives](https://valleyworker.coop/) provide peer support.

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Coops in Vermont

Vermont offers two primary paths for structuring a worker cooperative: the **Worker Cooperative Corporation** under state statute and the **Limited Liability Company (LLC)** with cooperative operating provisions.

### Option A: Worker Cooperative Corporation (Recommended)

Under [11 V.S.A. Chapter 8](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/chapter/11/008), Vermont provides a specific statutory framework for worker cooperative corporations. This is generally the preferred structure for most worker cooperatives.

**Advantages:**

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Legal protection** | Statute requires adherence to one-member-one-vote regardless of capital invested |
| **Name exclusivity** | Only worker cooperative corporations may use "cooperative" or abbreviations in their business name ([11 V.S.A. Section 981](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/11/007/00981)) |
| **Subchapter T taxation** | Allows the cooperative to avoid entity-level tax on revenue generated by members |
| **Familiar tax treatment** | Members receive W-2s and file taxes annually; the cooperative handles employment tax withholding |
| **Investor familiarity** | Traditional investors are more comfortable with corporate share structures |
| **Scalability** | Clearer provisions for member departure and capital account management |
| **Capital gains deferral** | Selling owners may defer capital gains taxes under IRC Section 1042 |

**Key statutory provisions (Chapter 8):**

| Section | Topic |
|---------|-------|
| Section 1082 | Definitions (member, membership share, patronage) |
| Section 1083 | Election to be governed as worker cooperative |
| Section 1086 | Member shares, fees, rights, and responsibilities |
| Section 1087 | Voting shares and bylaws |
| Section 1088 | Net earnings/losses apportionment and distribution |
| Section 1089 | Directors and officers |
| Sections 1090-1091 | Internal capital accounts and collective reserve |

**Requirements:**
- At least 50.1% of regular full-time and part-time workers must be members
- No person may be accepted as a member unless employed by the cooperative
- Members must always constitute a majority of the board (non-members may serve as directors)
- Filing fee: $155 (note: some sources indicate $125; verify current fee with Secretary of State)
- Annual renewal required

### Option B: Limited Liability Company (LLC)

An LLC structured with cooperative provisions in its Operating Agreement offers flexibility but has significant limitations.

**Advantages:**
- Greater governance flexibility (no mandatory board of directors)
- Simpler initial formation requirements
- Pass-through taxation by default
- May benefit workers with barriers to traditional employment (e.g., immigration status)

**Disadvantages:**
- **Cannot use "cooperative" in business name** (may use "collective" or similar terms)
- Risk that future members could amend cooperative principles out of Operating Agreement
- More complex tax accounting as LLC grows; members receive K-1s and pay self-employment tax quarterly
- Vermont imposes a $250 annual business entity income tax on LLCs
- Vermont offers weaker LLC creditor protections compared to many states

### Option C: Mutual Benefit Enterprise

Vermont's Mutual Benefit Enterprise Act (enacted 2012) creates a hybrid structure combining LLC and cooperative characteristics, allowing both voting investor members and patron members. May be suitable for cooperatives seeking external investment while maintaining democratic worker control.

**Recommendation:** The Worker Cooperative Corporation under 11 V.S.A. Chapter 8 is typically the better choice for most situations. The legal protections for cooperative principles, clearer taxation through Subchapter T, ability to use "cooperative" in the name, and established statutory framework make it the standard choice in Vermont.

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

Converting an existing business to worker ownership is a proven path in Vermont, with VEOC having facilitated numerous successful transitions.

### Why Consider Conversion?

**For Selling Owners:**
- Preserve business legacy and community relationships
- Sell to employees who understand the business
- Potential capital gains tax deferral under IRC Section 1042
- Flexible deal structuring with seller financing
- Lower setup costs compared to ESOPs

**For Employees:**
- Wealth-building opportunity
- Democratic participation in workplace governance
- Job preservation in the community
- Improved retention (observed during conversion processes)

### The Conversion Process

**Phase 1: Exploration (3-6 months)**
1. Contact VEOC for free pre-feasibility assessment
2. Gauge employee interest and capacity
3. Assess business financial health and viability
4. Determine if worker cooperative is best fit (vs. ESOP or EOT)

**Phase 2: Planning (6-12 months)**
1. Conduct detailed feasibility study
2. Obtain professional business valuation
3. Design deal structure (terms, pricing, financing)
4. Assemble financing (seller financing, VEOLF, CFNE, bank loans)
5. Draft governance documents

**Phase 3: Execution (3-6 months)**
1. Finalize all legal documentation
2. Train future worker-owners on cooperative principles
3. File Articles of Amendment electing worker cooperative status
4. Execute purchase agreement and close transaction
5. Implement transition with ongoing technical assistance

### Tax Benefits: Section 1042 Capital Gains Deferral

Selling owners may defer (and potentially eliminate) capital gains taxes under [IRC Section 1042](https://becomingemployeeowned.org/learn/execute/1042-rollover/):

**Requirements:**
- Sale to ESOP or eligible worker-owned cooperative
- Cooperative must own at least 30% of outstanding stock after sale
- Seller must have held qualified securities for at least 3 years
- Proceeds reinvested in Qualified Replacement Property within 12 months
- Company must be C corporation at time of sale

**Potential for permanent elimination:** If QRP is held until death, heirs receive stepped-up basis, potentially eliminating deferred gain entirely.

## 7. Common Pitfalls in Vermont

Even with Vermont's supportive environment, awareness of common challenges helps avoid them.

### Formation and Governance Pitfalls

**1. Confusing Ownership with Management**
- Democratic ownership does not mean every decision is voted on
- Cooperatives naturally move slower than sole-owner businesses, leading some to "go rogue" and take unilateral action
- **Solution:** Clearly define which decisions are member votes, board decisions, or management discretion; establish efficient processes and respect them

**2. Inadequate Documentation**
- Operating and governance documents should answer important questions before they arise
- Documents must outlast founding members
- **Solution:** Invest time upfront in comprehensive bylaws; consider professional legal assistance

**3. Patronage Definition Issues**
- Unclear methods for measuring work contribution lead to conflict
- **Solution:** Define patronage clearly in bylaws before launching; document tracking procedures

**4. Premature Marketing Investment**
- Purchasing signs, business cards, or websites before name confirmation
- **Solution:** Wait for Secretary of State approval before any marketing spend

### Business Fundamentals

**5. Neglecting the Business Model**
- Cooperative structure alone does not ensure success
- Your product/service must be viable independently
- **Solution:** Do not let governance discussions overshadow business development

**6. Undercapitalization**
- Member buy-ins alone may not provide adequate funding
- **Solution:** Develop comprehensive financial projections; leverage Vermont's financing ecosystem (VEOLF, CFNE) early

### Operational Challenges

**7. Slow Decision-Making**
- Democratic processes can be time-consuming
- **Solution:** Establish clear delegation of authority; reserve member votes for major decisions; set meeting time limits

**8. Difficulty Attracting Capital**
- Traditional lenders unfamiliar with cooperative structures
- **Solution:** Work with cooperative-friendly lenders; build relationships with CDFIs

**9. Member Recruitment and Retention**
- Finding employees willing to invest and participate
- Managing departures and capital account redemptions
- **Solution:** Establish reasonable buy-ins with payment plans; develop transparent redemption policies

### Compliance Issues

**10. Missing Annual Filings**
- Failure to file annual reports risks administrative dissolution
- **Solution:** Calendar all deadlines; set reminders; maintain current registered agent

**11. Inadequate Record-Keeping**
- Poor documentation of capital accounts and patronage
- **Solution:** Implement robust accounting systems from day one; consider cooperative-specialized accountants

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for Vermont

### Q1: How much does it cost to form a worker cooperative in Vermont?

**Basic formation costs:**
- Articles of Incorporation filing: $125-$155
- Name reservation (optional): $20
- EIN: Free
- State tax registration: Free

**Additional costs to budget:**
- Legal fees for bylaws and documents: $1,500-$5,000+
- Accounting setup: $500-$2,000
- Business licenses (varies by municipality and industry)

VEOC provides free pre-feasibility consulting, which can reduce overall costs.

### Q2: Can we use "cooperative" or "co-op" in our business name?

**Yes, if you form as a Worker Cooperative Corporation** under 11 V.S.A. Chapter 8. Vermont statute specifically reserves "cooperative" and its abbreviations for worker cooperative corporations, cooperative housing corporations, and associations meeting specific statutory requirements. LLCs cannot use "cooperative" but may use terms like "collective."

### Q3: What is the minimum number of members required?

Vermont statute does not specify a minimum number of worker-members. However, the statute requires that members constitute at least 50.1% of the regular full-time and part-time workforce. Practically, most worker cooperatives start with 3-5 founding members.

### Q4: How are profits distributed in a Vermont worker cooperative?

Profits (net earnings) are distributed based on "patronage" - the amount of work performed as a member, as defined in the articles or bylaws. Patronage is typically measured by hours worked or compensation received. Members may also authorize retention of earnings in individual internal capital accounts or a collective reserve account.

### Q5: Can non-employees own shares in a Vermont worker cooperative?

Under Chapter 8, only persons employed by the cooperative on a regular full-time or part-time basis may be members. Non-members may serve as directors (though they cannot be a majority of the board). Non-employee investors may provide financing through loans rather than equity.

### Q6: What happens to a member's capital account when they leave?

The bylaws specify the redemption procedure. Typically, the cooperative pays out the departing member's internal capital account balance according to a defined schedule (often over 3-5 years) to protect cash flow. Exact terms must be established in organizing documents.

### Q7: How are worker-members taxed?

**For Worker Cooperative Corporations (Subchapter T):**
- Members are employees and receive W-2s
- Cooperative withholds employment taxes
- Patronage dividends taxed as income when received
- Retained allocations may defer taxation

**For LLCs:**
- Members receive K-1s for distributive share
- Self-employment tax applies
- Quarterly estimated tax payments typically required

### Q8: Can non-citizen workers be members?

Work authorization affects entity choice:
- **Worker Cooperative Corporation:** Members are employees, so work authorization is required
- **LLC:** Members are owners (not employees), which may provide a pathway for workers without employment authorization

Consult with an immigration attorney for specific situations.
