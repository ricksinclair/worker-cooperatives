# How to Start a Worker Cooperative in Idaho

A comprehensive guide to forming and operating a worker-owned cooperative business in the Gem State.

---

## 1. Quick Summary

**What Makes Idaho Unique for Worker Cooperatives:**

Idaho presents a distinctive landscape for worker cooperative formation. While the state does not have a dedicated worker cooperative statute, it offers several viable pathways for structuring worker-owned businesses. Idaho Code Title 30 includes provisions for cooperative corporations under the Nonprofit Corporation Act (Chapter 30), and the state's flexible LLC statute allows for cooperative-style operating agreements.

Key characteristics of Idaho's environment for worker cooperatives:

- **No dedicated worker cooperative statute** - Idaho Code Chapter 26 (where limited cooperative associations would typically be found) is currently reserved
- **Cooperative provisions exist within the Nonprofit Corporation Act** - Idaho Code Title 30, Chapter 30 defines and permits cooperative corporations
- **Flexible LLC framework** - Idaho's Limited Liability Company Act (Title 30, Chapter 25) permits significant customization through operating agreements
- **Low filing fees** - Idaho offers competitive business formation costs ($100 for LLCs and corporations online)
- **No annual report fees** - Idaho does not charge for online annual report filings
- **Regional support available** - The Northwest Cooperative Development Center (NWCDC) serves Idaho with technical assistance and financing

**Common Entity Choices for Worker Cooperatives in Idaho:**

1. **LLC structured as a cooperative** - Most common approach; offers liability protection with flexible governance
2. **Cooperative corporation under the Nonprofit Act** - Suitable for member-service cooperatives; defined in Idaho Code Section 30-30-103
3. **Standard corporation with cooperative bylaws** - For-profit corporation structured cooperatively through bylaws

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives in Idaho

### Option A: Cooperative Corporation Under the Nonprofit Corporation Act

Idaho Code Title 30, Chapter 30 (the [Idaho Nonprofit Corporation Act](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title30/t30ch30/)) explicitly recognizes cooperative corporations.

**Key Statutory Provisions:**

Under [Idaho Code Section 30-30-103](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title30/t30ch30/sect30-30-103/), a "Cooperative corporation" or "cooperative" is defined as:

> "Any nonprofit corporation, operating on a cooperative basis, owned, operated, organized and maintained by its members, for the purpose of providing goods or services to its members."

**Important Features:**

- Bylaws may contain provisions for regulating and managing affairs that are not inconsistent with law or articles of incorporation
- Members who patronize the cooperative are bound by the articles, bylaws, policies, rules, and regulations as a contract
- Members must agree to use services furnished by the corporation when available
- Cooperative corporations have lien rights on member equity under [Idaho Code Section 45-809](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title45/t45ch8/sect45-809/)

**Considerations:**

- This structure is technically designed for member-service cooperatives rather than worker-owned enterprises
- May be appropriate for worker cooperatives where workers are also receiving services from the cooperative
- Nonprofit status may limit profit distribution options
- Consult with an attorney to determine if this structure fits your worker cooperative model

### Option B: Limited Liability Company (LLC) Structured as a Cooperative

This is typically the **most common and flexible approach** for worker cooperatives in Idaho.

**Why LLCs Work Well:**

- Idaho's LLC statute ([Title 30, Chapter 25](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title30/t30ch25/)) allows extensive customization through operating agreements
- Members can structure voting rights, profit allocation, and governance to mirror cooperative principles
- Pass-through taxation simplifies patronage-based distributions
- Limited liability protection for all members
- No minimum capital requirements

**Cooperative Features You Can Include in an LLC Operating Agreement:**

1. **One-member-one-vote governance** (regardless of capital contribution)
2. **Patronage-based allocations** (distributions based on labor hours or other work metrics rather than capital)
3. **Member classes** (probationary, full member, retired member)
4. **Democratic decision-making procedures**
5. **Membership buy-in and redemption provisions**
6. **Retained patronage accounts**

**Tax Considerations:**

- LLCs are typically taxed as partnerships (pass-through) by default
- Patronage allocations should be carefully structured with a qualified accountant
- Consider Subchapter T taxation rules if operating on a cooperative basis
- The LLC can elect to be taxed as a corporation if beneficial

### Option C: For-Profit Corporation with Cooperative Bylaws

A standard Idaho business corporation can be structured cooperatively through its bylaws.

**When This May Be Appropriate:**

- Seeking outside investment (can issue different share classes)
- Planning significant growth with external capital
- Industry-specific requirements favor corporate structure
- Considering future ESOP conversion

**Limitations:**

- Corporation statute has more rigid governance requirements than LLC
- One-share-one-vote is the default (must specify otherwise in articles)
- More formalities required (board meetings, minutes, etc.)

### Option D: Limited Cooperative Association (LCA)

**Current Status in Idaho:**

Idaho Code Chapter 26 is currently **[RESERVED]**, meaning Idaho has not enacted the Uniform Limited Cooperative Association Act. Under [Idaho Code Section 30-21-102](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title30/t30ch21/sect30-21-102/), "Limited cooperative association" refers only to foreign limited cooperative associations.

**Practical Implication:**

If you want to operate as an LCA in Idaho, you would need to:
1. Form the LCA in a state that has adopted the ULCAA (such as Colorado, Utah, or Washington)
2. Register as a foreign limited cooperative association in Idaho

This approach adds complexity and ongoing compliance in multiple states, so it is typically not recommended unless there are specific reasons to use the LCA structure.

### Recommendation

For most worker cooperatives in Idaho, **forming an LLC with a cooperative operating agreement** is typically the most practical approach. This provides:

- Maximum flexibility in structuring governance and allocations
- Limited liability protection
- Simplicity in formation and ongoing compliance
- Compatibility with cooperative principles

Consult with an attorney experienced in cooperative law to determine the best structure for your specific situation.

## 4. Governance and Documents You Should Prepare

### Operating Agreement (for LLCs) or Bylaws (for Corporations)

This is the most critical document for establishing your cooperative's governance structure.

**Essential Provisions for Worker Cooperatives:**

#### Membership

- **Eligibility requirements:** Who can become a member (e.g., employees who work a minimum number of hours)
- **Probationary period:** Typical range is 3-12 months before full membership
- **Buy-in amount:** Initial capital contribution required to become a member
- **Member classes:** Consider categories such as:
  - Probationary members (limited voting rights)
  - Full worker-members (full voting and economic rights)
  - Retired/emeritus members
  - Non-member employees (if applicable)

#### Voting Rights

- **One-member-one-vote:** Standard cooperative principle regardless of capital contribution
- **Matters requiring member vote:** Admission of new members, amendments, major decisions, dissolution
- **Quorum requirements:** Typically 50% or more of members
- **Supermajority requirements:** For major decisions (e.g., 2/3 or 3/4 vote for amendments, dissolution)
- **Proxy voting:** Whether permitted and under what circumstances
- **Electronic voting:** Procedures for remote participation

#### Patronage and Allocations

**Patronage Basis:**

Define how "patronage" is measured. Common approaches for worker cooperatives:
- Hours worked
- Wages earned
- Equal allocation per member

**Allocation of Net Income:**

- **Retained earnings/reserves:** Percentage retained for business operations (commonly 20-40%)
- **Patronage dividends:** Distribution to members based on patronage
- **Internal capital accounts:** Individual member accounts tracking allocated but unpaid patronage

**Payment of Patronage:**

- Timing of distributions (annual, quarterly)
- Written notices of allocation (required for tax purposes)
- Redemption schedules for retained patronage

#### Governance Structure

- **Board of Directors:** Size, terms, election procedures, powers
- **Officers:** Roles, selection, responsibilities
- **Committees:** Standing committees and their authority
- **Member meetings:** Annual meeting requirements, special meetings
- **Decision-making processes:** Consensus, majority vote, or hybrid approaches

#### Member Rights and Responsibilities

- Work obligations and expectations
- Participation in governance
- Access to financial information
- Confidentiality requirements

#### Exit and Redemption

- **Voluntary withdrawal:** Notice requirements, redemption of capital
- **Involuntary termination:** Grounds for removal, due process procedures
- **Death or disability:** Handling of member's interest
- **Redemption timeline:** When and how capital accounts are paid out

### Additional Documents to Prepare

1. **Member Agreement/Application:** Document signed by each member acknowledging rights and responsibilities

2. **Employment Handbook:** Standard workplace policies (can be separate from or incorporated into operating agreement)

3. **Conflict of Interest Policy:** Procedures for handling conflicts

4. **Financial Policies:** Banking, check signing authority, financial reporting

5. **Membership Buy-In Agreement:** Terms for purchasing membership interest

6. **Patron Notice:** Written notice of patronage allocation (required for tax treatment)

### Sample Language Considerations

When drafting cooperative provisions, include clear statements such as:

- "The Company shall operate on a cooperative basis for the mutual benefit of its members."
- "Each member shall have one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of members, regardless of capital contribution."
- "Net margins shall be allocated to members on the basis of patronage, measured by [hours worked/wages earned]."

### Professional Assistance

Given the complexity of cooperative governance documents, it is typically advisable to:

- Work with an attorney experienced in cooperative law
- Review sample documents from cooperative development organizations
- Consult the Northwest Cooperative Development Center for templates and guidance

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions in Idaho

### Overview

Converting an existing business to worker ownership is an increasingly popular succession strategy for retiring business owners. In Idaho, conversions typically use either the cooperative model or an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).

### Worker Cooperative Conversion

**How It Works:**

1. **Assessment:** Evaluate whether the business and workforce are suitable for cooperative conversion
2. **Valuation:** Determine fair market value of the business
3. **Structure:** Design the cooperative structure, membership terms, and governance
4. **Financing:** Arrange purchase financing (seller financing is common)
5. **Legal formation:** Create the cooperative entity and transfer ownership
6. **Transition:** Train worker-owners in governance and management

**Advantages:**

- Workers gain ownership and democratic control
- Preserves jobs and local business presence
- Can qualify for Section 1042 tax deferral for sellers (C-corporation sellers only)
- Lower ongoing administrative costs than ESOPs
- Flexibility in governance structure

**Considerations:**

- Workers must be prepared for ownership responsibilities
- Financing can be challenging without traditional collateral
- Requires strong internal leadership

### ESOP Conversion

**How It Works:**

An Employee Stock Ownership Plan is a qualified retirement plan that invests primarily in employer stock. The company sets up a trust that purchases shares from the owner, and employees earn shares over time.

**Advantages:**

- Significant tax benefits for sellers (Section 1042 rollover)
- Tax-deductible contributions to the ESOP
- S-corporation ESOPs have additional tax advantages
- Shares allocated to employees as retirement benefit
- Can accommodate larger transactions

**Considerations:**

- Higher setup and ongoing administrative costs
- Regulated as a retirement plan (ERISA requirements)
- One-share-one-vote not required (though can be structured democratically)
- Typically requires 20+ employees to be cost-effective
- Annual valuation and compliance requirements

### ESOP vs. Cooperative Comparison

| Factor | Worker Cooperative | ESOP |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| **Governance** | One-member-one-vote (standard) | One-share-one-vote (typical) |
| **Regulation** | State business law | Federal ERISA retirement rules |
| **Setup Cost** | Lower | Higher |
| **Ongoing Admin** | Lower | Higher (annual valuation, etc.) |
| **Company Size** | Any size | Typically 20+ employees |
| **Seller Tax Benefits** | 1042 rollover (C-corp) | 1042 rollover (C-corp) |
| **Employee Tax** | Taxed when distributed | Tax-deferred until distribution |

### Section 1042 Tax Deferral

Both cooperative conversions and ESOPs can qualify sellers for Section 1042 capital gains deferral if:

- The company is a C-corporation
- At least 30% of outstanding stock is sold to the cooperative or ESOP
- Seller reinvests proceeds in qualified replacement property within 12 months
- Seller held the stock for at least 3 years

### Resources for Conversions in Idaho

## 7. Common Pitfalls in Idaho

### Legal Structure Mistakes

1. **Assuming Idaho has a worker cooperative statute**
   - Idaho does not have dedicated worker cooperative legislation
   - Chapter 26 (Limited Cooperative Associations) is reserved
   - Plan to use LLC or other available structures

2. **Misunderstanding the cooperative corporation provisions**
   - Idaho Code Section 30-30-103 defines cooperatives within the Nonprofit Corporation Act
   - This structure is designed for member-service cooperatives
   - May not fit all worker cooperative models

3. **Inadequate operating agreement/bylaws**
   - Default Idaho LLC rules assume profit-sharing based on capital contribution
   - Must explicitly establish one-member-one-vote governance
   - Patronage allocation provisions must be clearly documented

### Tax and Compliance Errors

4. **Failing to structure for Subchapter T treatment**
   - Patronage dividends require specific documentation
   - Written notices of allocation are required
   - Work with an accountant familiar with cooperative taxation

5. **Missing state tax registrations**
   - Must register separately with Idaho State Tax Commission and Department of Labor
   - EIN required before applying for Idaho withholding account

6. **Neglecting local licensing requirements**
   - No state-level business license in Idaho
   - Each city/county has different requirements
   - Check with local clerk's office before starting operations

### Governance Challenges

7. **Insufficient member education**
   - Worker-owners need training in cooperative principles
   - Financial literacy and governance skills are essential
   - Budget time and resources for ongoing education

   - Establish probationary periods and evaluation processes
   - Document buy-in requirements and redemption procedures

9. **Inadequate capitalization**
   - Worker cooperatives often undercapitalize at startup
   - Plan for adequate working capital
   - Consider multiple capital sources (member equity, loans, grants)

### Operational Issues

    - Separate democratic ownership from day-to-day operations
    - Clarify when management decisions require member votes
    - Establish clear authority and accountability

11. **No exit or dispute resolution procedures**

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q1: Does Idaho have a specific worker cooperative statute?

**A:** No, Idaho does not have a dedicated worker cooperative statute. Idaho Code Chapter 26 (where Limited Cooperative Associations would typically be found) is currently reserved. However, worker cooperatives can form using other available structures:

- **LLC with cooperative operating agreement** (most common)
- **Cooperative corporation under the Nonprofit Corporation Act** (Idaho Code Section 30-30-103)
- **Standard corporation with cooperative bylaws**

The LLC structure is typically preferred because it offers flexibility in governance and profit allocation while providing limited liability protection.

### Q2: How much does it cost to form a worker cooperative in Idaho?

**A:** Basic formation costs in Idaho are relatively low:

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| LLC Certificate of Organization (online) | $100 |
| Corporation Articles of Incorporation (online) | $100 |
| Nonprofit Corporation (online) | $30 |
| Name Reservation (optional, online) | $20 |
| EIN from IRS | Free |
| Annual Report (online) | Free |

Additional costs may include:

- Attorney fees for operating agreement/bylaws: $1,500-$5,000+
- Accountant fees for tax setup: $500-$2,000
- Registered agent service (if using third party): $50-$300/year

### Q3: Can we use the cooperative corporation structure under Idaho's Nonprofit Corporation Act?

**A:** Yes, but with important considerations. Idaho Code Section 30-30-103 defines a cooperative corporation as a nonprofit corporation "for the purpose of providing goods or services to its members." This structure is designed for member-service cooperatives (where members are patrons/customers) rather than traditional worker cooperatives (where members are employees).

If you use this structure:

- Members must agree to use services furnished by the corporation
- The nonprofit status may limit profit distribution options
- Consult with an attorney to determine if this structure fits your model

For most worker cooperatives, an LLC structured cooperatively is typically more appropriate.

### Q4: Do we need a registered agent in Idaho?

**A:** Yes, all LLCs and corporations in Idaho must maintain a registered agent with a physical street address in Idaho. The registered agent:

- Must be available during normal business hours
- Receives legal documents and official state correspondence
- Can be a member of the cooperative, an employee, or a professional registered agent service

P.O. Boxes are not acceptable for registered agent addresses.

### Q5: How do we handle patronage dividends in Idaho?

**A:** Patronage dividends are distributions to members based on their patronage (work contribution) rather than capital investment. To properly structure patronage dividends:

1. **Document in operating agreement:** Clearly define how patronage is measured (hours worked, wages earned, etc.) and how net margins are allocated

2. **Maintain records:** Track each member's patronage and capital account

3. **Issue written notices:** For tax purposes, provide written notice of patronage allocation within 8.5 months of year-end

4. **Work with an accountant:** Cooperative taxation under Subchapter T has specific requirements

The cooperative can deduct patronage dividends paid to members, avoiding double taxation on distributed earnings.

### Q6: What support is available for worker cooperatives in Idaho?

**A:** Key resources include:

- **Northwest Cooperative Development Center (NWCDC):** Primary regional cooperative development organization serving Idaho - [nwcdc.coop](https://nwcdc.coop/)
- **Idaho SBDC Network:** Free business consulting services - [idahosbdc.org](https://idahosbdc.org/)
- **U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives:** National networking and support - [usworker.coop](https://www.usworker.coop/)
- **Seed Commons:** Non-extractive financing for worker cooperatives - [seedcommons.org](https://seedcommons.org/)

### Q7: Can an existing Idaho business convert to a worker cooperative?

**A:** Yes, business conversions to worker cooperatives are possible in Idaho. The process typically involves:

1. Assessing feasibility and worker interest
2. Valuing the business
3. Structuring the cooperative (usually as an LLC)
4. Arranging financing (often seller financing combined with other sources)
5. Transferring ownership and training worker-owners

The Northwest Cooperative Development Center specializes in cooperative conversions and serves Idaho businesses. For C-corporation sales, sellers may qualify for Section 1042 capital gains tax deferral if at least 30% is sold to the cooperative.

### Q8: Are there annual filing requirements for worker cooperatives in Idaho?

**A:** Yes, all business entities in Idaho must file an annual report with the Secretary of State:

- **Due date:** End of the month in which the entity was originally formed
- **Filing fee:** Free for online filing ($20 for paper)
- **Where to file:** [sosbiz.idaho.gov](https://sosbiz.idaho.gov/)

Additional ongoing requirements may include:

- Idaho income tax withholding filings (if you have employees)
- Sales tax filings (if applicable)
- Local business license renewals
- Federal tax returns

Failure to file annual reports can result in administrative dissolution of your entity.
