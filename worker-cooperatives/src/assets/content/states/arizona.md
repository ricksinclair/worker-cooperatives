# How to Open a Worker Cooperative in Arizona

A comprehensive guide to forming and operating a worker-owned cooperative business in the State of Arizona.

---

## 1. Quick Summary

**What makes Arizona unique for worker cooperatives:**

Arizona has cooperative statutes primarily designed for **agricultural and electric cooperatives** under Arizona Revised Statutes Title 10, Chapter 19. Unlike some states, Arizona does not have a dedicated worker cooperative corporation statute. However, the state's flexible business entity laws allow worker cooperatives to form effectively using other structures.

**Key distinguishing features:**
- Cooperative Marketing Association statute (A.R.S. Title 10, Chapter 19, Article 1) was updated in 2014 and revised in 2016 to expand cooperative incorporation options
- No state-issued general business license required; licensing is handled at the local municipal level
- No publication requirement for LLCs in Maricopa County or Pima County (where Phoenix and Tucson are located)
- Active cooperative development through the **Arizona Cooperative Initiative**, a Phoenix-based statewide organization
- Home to **Technicians for Sustainability**, a notable worker cooperative in Tucson that incorporated in Colorado due to Arizona's limited worker cooperative statute

**Common entity choices for worker coops in Arizona:**
1. **Limited Liability Company (LLC)** with cooperative operating agreement - Most common and flexible approach
2. **Domestic Cooperative Marketing Association** (A.R.S. Title 10, Chapter 19) - Available but designed primarily for agricultural/producer cooperatives
3. **Standard Corporation** (C-Corp or S-Corp) with cooperative bylaws - Less common but viable
4. **Out-of-state incorporation** - Some Arizona worker cooperatives (like Technicians for Sustainability) have incorporated in states with stronger worker cooperative statutes (e.g., Colorado) while operating in Arizona

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Coops in Arizona

### Option A: LLC with Cooperative Operating Agreement (Recommended)

**Statutory Authority:** [Arizona Revised Statutes Title 29, Chapter 7 - Arizona Limited Liability Company Act](https://www.azleg.gov/arsDetail/?title=29)

An LLC structured with a cooperative operating agreement is typically the most practical choice for worker cooperatives in Arizona. The state's LLC law provides significant flexibility to create democratic governance structures.

**Key Operating Agreement Provisions for Cooperative LLCs:**

1. **One-Member-One-Vote:** The Arizona Limited Liability Company Act allows operating agreements to override default rules. You can explicitly establish that each member has one vote regardless of capital contribution.

2. **Patronage-Based Distributions:** The operating agreement can specify that profits are distributed based on labor contribution (patronage) rather than capital investment.

3. **Membership Classes:** Define a worker-member class with specific rights, obligations, and equity structures.

4. **Buyback Provisions:** Include terms for redeeming member interests upon departure.

**Management Structure Options:**
- **Member-Managed:** All members participate in management decisions and can bind the LLC - aligns well with democratic cooperative principles
- **Manager-Managed:** Designated managers handle day-to-day operations while members retain governance authority

**Advantages:**
- Pass-through taxation (avoids double taxation)
- Highly flexible governance structure through operating agreement
- Less formal requirements than corporations
- No publication requirement in Maricopa or Pima Counties
- Operating agreement is an internal document (not filed with the state)

**Considerations:**
- Cannot officially use "cooperative" or "co-op" in entity name under standard LLC rules
- Must carefully draft operating agreement to achieve cooperative principles
- No dedicated statutory guidance for cooperative-specific issues

**Filing Fee:** $50 (Arizona Corporation Commission)

---

### Option B: Domestic Cooperative Marketing Association

**Statutory Authority:** [Arizona Revised Statutes Title 10, Chapter 19, Article 1 - Cooperative Marketing Associations](https://www.azleg.gov/arsDetail/?title=10) (Sections 10-2001 through 10-2026)

Arizona's cooperative statute is primarily designed for agricultural and producer cooperatives, but the 2014 and 2016 amendments expanded its scope.

**Who Can Form (Section 10-2003):**
- Five or more persons engaged in the production of agricultural products
- Five or more small businesses, individuals or entities engaged in the marketing and distribution of manufactured goods for import and export purposes
- Five or more persons for the purpose of producing, manufacturing and selling hydroponic greenhouses or growing food

**Key Provisions:**

**Membership (Section 10-2060):**
- Each incorporator must be a member
- Membership qualifications established in bylaws
- Membership is not transferable except as provided in bylaws
- Husband and wife may hold joint membership

**Formation Requirements:**
- Articles of Incorporation must align with A.R.S. Title 10, Chapter 19
- Required documents: Articles of Incorporation, Statutory Agent Acceptance, Certificate of Disclosure
- Must be filed with the Arizona Corporation Commission

**Important Note:** Due to e-Corp online filing system limitations, registering a cooperative requires in-person or fax submission (not available through standard online filing).

**Advantages:**
- Dedicated cooperative legal framework
- Can use "cooperative" in entity name
- Statutory recognition of cooperative principles

**Considerations:**
- Statute designed primarily for agricultural/producer cooperatives
- May not be ideal fit for service-based worker cooperatives
- Requires in-person or fax filing (cannot use online system)
- Bylaws must comply with both state statutes and articles of incorporation

---

### Option C: Standard Corporation with Cooperative Bylaws

A traditional business corporation (C-Corp or S-Corp) can adopt bylaws incorporating cooperative principles.

**When this might be appropriate:**
- Planning to seek outside investment in the future
- Desire for well-established corporate law precedents
- Specific industry requirements favor corporate structure
- Potential Section 1042 rollover for conversions (C-Corp required)

**Filing Fee:** $60 (Arizona Corporation Commission)

---

### Option D: Out-of-State Incorporation

Some Arizona worker cooperatives have chosen to incorporate in states with stronger worker cooperative statutes while operating as a foreign entity in Arizona.

**Example:** Technicians for Sustainability (Tucson) incorporated in **Colorado** in 2017, following the model of Namaste Solar and utilizing Colorado's worker cooperative legal framework and experienced legal support.

**Considerations:**
- Requires registering as a foreign entity in Arizona
- Subject to regulations in both states
- Additional filing fees and compliance requirements
- Access to more robust worker cooperative legal framework

---

### Worker Coop-Friendly Provisions Worth Noting

1. **Section 1042 Rollover Eligibility:** Selling business owners may defer capital gains when selling 30% or more of C-corporation stock to an employee cooperative.

2. **Flexible LLC Law:** Arizona's LLC Act allows significant customization through operating agreements, enabling cooperative governance structures.

3. **No State Business License:** Arizona does not require a state-level general business license, reducing one layer of bureaucracy.

4. **Publication Exemption:** LLCs with statutory agents in Maricopa or Pima Counties are exempt from newspaper publication requirements (effective September 2024).

## 4. Governance and Documents You Should Prepare

### Operating Agreement (for LLCs) or Bylaws (for Corporations)

- **Voluntary Withdrawal:** Notice requirements and equity redemption timeline
- **Involuntary Termination:** Grounds and process for removing members
- **Death or Disability:** Treatment of membership shares
- **Redemption Schedule:** Timeline for paying out departing member's capital account (often 3-5 years to protect cooperative cash flow)

#### Board of Directors (if applicable)
- **Composition:** Number of directors, term lengths
- **Election Process:** How directors are elected by members
- **Officer Roles:** President, Secretary, Treasurer duties
- **Committees:** Standing committees and their authorities

#### Meetings

### Additional Documents to Prepare

1. **Member Handbook:** Policies, procedures, expectations for worker-owners
2. **Membership Agreement:** Contract signed by each member upon joining
3. **Patronage Policy:** Detailed explanation of how patronage is calculated and distributed
4. **Conflict of Interest Policy:** Especially important for democratic organizations
5. **Buy-Sell Agreement:** Terms for member share transfers
6. **Decision-Making Matrix:** Clear delineation of what requires member vote vs. manager authority

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

### Converting an Existing Business to Worker Ownership

Business succession through worker ownership is an increasingly popular option in Arizona, particularly for owners approaching retirement without family successors or those committed to preserving jobs and business legacy.

The Arizona Cooperative Initiative describes cooperative conversion as "economic democracy in action" - recognizing that employees are often the best ones to take over a business.

### Two Primary Paths: Worker Cooperative vs. ESOP

| Factor | Worker Cooperative | ESOP |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| **Best Fit** | Smaller businesses (<100 employees) | Larger businesses (typically 20+ employees) |
| **Setup Cost** | Lower ($10,000-$50,000 typical) | Higher ($50,000-$150,000+) |
| **Ongoing Cost** | Lower (no annual valuations required) | Higher (annual appraisals, trustee fees) |
| **Governance** | One-member-one-vote | Voting typically proportional to shares |
| **Tax Treatment** | Pass-through (if LLC or S-Corp) | C-Corp can be 100% tax-exempt |
| **Section 1042 Rollover** | Available for C-Corps | Available for C-Corps |
| **Federal Regulation** | Minimal | Heavy ERISA/DOL regulation |
| **Democratic Control** | Built into structure | Optional, requires specific design |

### Section 1042 Rollover for Both Models

Selling owners of C-corporations can defer capital gains taxes when selling 30% or more of company stock to either:
- An ESOP, or
- A qualified worker cooperative

**Requirements:**
- Seller must reinvest proceeds in qualified replacement property (domestic securities) within 12 months
- Company must be a C-corporation
- While widely used by ESOPs, the 1042 rollover is also available for worker cooperatives

### Typical Conversion Process for Worker Cooperative

**Stage 1: Feasibility Assessment**
- Business valuation
- Financial analysis and projections
- Worker interest assessment
- Determine if cooperative structure is appropriate

**Stage 2: Transition Planning**
- Timeline development (typically 1-3 years)
- Financing structure design
- Leadership succession planning
- Worker education about ownership

**Stage 3: Legal Structure**
- Entity conversion or new entity formation
- Purchase agreement negotiation
- Governing document drafting (bylaws/operating agreement)
- Tax planning

**Stage 4: Financing the Buyout**
- Seller financing (most common - owner carries note)
- Bank loans (SBA loans are available)
- Worker capital contributions
- Combination approaches

**Stage 5: Implementation**
- Governance training for new worker-owners
- Operational transition
- Ongoing support and development

### Arizona-Specific Considerations

- **No Dedicated Statute:** Arizona lacks a specific worker cooperative conversion statute, so conversions typically use LLC or standard corporation structures
- **Out-of-State Option:** Some Arizona businesses (like Technicians for Sustainability) have chosen to incorporate in states with stronger worker cooperative laws while maintaining Arizona operations
- **ACI Support:** The Arizona Cooperative Initiative works with Project Equity to support business conversions in Arizona

### Resources for Conversions

- [Arizona Cooperative Initiative](https://azcoopinitiative.coop/)
- [Project Equity](https://project-equity.org/)
- [Democracy at Work Institute - Conversions](https://institute.coop/topics/esops)
- [Ohio Employee Ownership Center](https://www.oeockent.org/cooperatives/selling-your-business-to-a-worker-owned-cooperative)
- [Becoming Employee Owned](https://becomingemployeeowned.org/)

**Recommendation:** Engage professionals experienced in cooperative conversions early in the process. The Arizona Cooperative Initiative can provide referrals to appropriate advisors.

## 7. Common Pitfalls in Arizona

### 1. Assuming Arizona Has a Worker Cooperative Statute

Arizona's cooperative statutes (A.R.S. Title 10, Chapter 19) are designed primarily for agricultural and electric cooperatives, not worker cooperatives. Forming as a Cooperative Marketing Association may not fit a service-based worker cooperative.

**Solution:** Most Arizona worker cooperatives form as LLCs with cooperative operating agreements. Consider consulting with the Arizona Cooperative Initiative or an attorney experienced in cooperative law about the best structure for your situation.

---

### 2. Using Generic Operating Agreement Templates

Standard LLC operating agreement templates do not include cooperative provisions. Using one without modification will not create a democratic, patronage-based structure.

**Solution:** Work with an attorney familiar with cooperative law to draft or customize your operating agreement. Key provisions needed:
- One-member-one-vote (overriding default proportional voting)
- Patronage-based profit distribution
- Internal capital account structure
- Member buyout terms

---

### 3. Neglecting TPT License Requirements

Businesses selling products or providing taxable services in Arizona must have a Transaction Privilege Tax license. Operating without one can result in penalties and back taxes.

**Solution:**
- Register through [AZTaxes.gov](https://www.aztaxes.gov/) before conducting taxable business
- Pay the $12 fee per location
- Remember annual renewal by January 1

---

### 4. Ignoring Local Licensing Requirements

Arizona does not have a state business license, but this doesn't mean you're license-free. Many cities and towns require their own business licenses.

**Solution:**
- Check requirements in every jurisdiction where you conduct business
- Contact city/town clerk offices directly
- Consider zoning compliance, especially for home-based businesses

---

### 5. Conflating Ownership with Day-to-Day Management

New worker cooperatives often assume all decisions must be made collectively, leading to inefficiency and frustration.

**Solution:** Clearly define in your operating agreement:
- Which decisions require member vote (governance, strategic)
- Which decisions are delegated to managers (operational, day-to-day)
- Decision-making authority levels
- How managers are selected and held accountable

---

### 6. Inadequate Capitalization

Worker cooperatives often start undercapitalized because workers have limited personal wealth to invest.

**Solution:**
- Develop realistic capital requirements before launch
- Consider phased membership buy-in over time (payroll deduction)
- Build collective reserves from retained earnings
- Explore external financing options early
- Factor in adequate working capital, not just startup costs

---

### 7. Failing to Maintain Statutory Agent

Arizona requires all LLCs and corporations to maintain a statutory agent continuously. Failure results in administrative dissolution.

**Solution:**
- Ensure continuous coverage, especially if using a member as agent
- Consider professional statutory agent services for reliability
- Update ACC promptly if your agent changes

---

### 8. Not Filing Publication (If Required)

LLCs in counties other than Maricopa or Pima must publish notice in an approved newspaper within 60 days of filing.

**Solution:**
- Determine if publication is required based on your statutory agent's county
- Use ACC-approved newspapers only
- File Affidavit of Publication after completing publication

---

### 9. Treating "Cooperative" as the Value Proposition

Being a cooperative is a business structure, not a product or service. Customers typically buy based on value, quality, and price.

**Solution:** Develop a strong business model independent of cooperative structure. Let your governance model inform your values and culture, but compete on business fundamentals.

---

### 10. Insufficient Member Education

Not all workers may be equally prepared for ownership responsibilities. Democratic governance requires informed participation.

**Solution:**
- Establish clear expectations during candidacy period
- Provide ongoing governance and financial literacy training
- Create meaningful participation opportunities beyond annual meetings
- Develop onboarding programs for new member-owners

---

## 8. FAQs for Arizona

### Q1: Does Arizona have a specific law for worker cooperatives?

**Not exactly.** Arizona's cooperative statutes (A.R.S. Title 10, Chapter 19) are designed primarily for agricultural producers, electric cooperatives, and related entities. The Cooperative Marketing Association statute was updated in 2014 and 2016 but remains focused on producer cooperatives rather than worker cooperatives. Most Arizona worker cooperatives form as LLCs with cooperative operating agreements, or incorporate in other states (like Colorado) with stronger worker cooperative statutes while operating in Arizona.

---

### Q2: Can I use "cooperative" or "co-op" in my Arizona business name?

**It depends on your entity type.** If you form as a Domestic Cooperative Marketing Association under A.R.S. Title 10, Chapter 19, you may include "cooperative" in your name. However, if you form as a standard LLC, using "cooperative" in the name is not standard practice and could potentially cause confusion about your legal structure. Some cooperatives use descriptive terms like "Collective" or structure their name differently (e.g., "Worker-Owned").

---

### Q3: How much does it cost to form a worker cooperative in Arizona?

**Typical costs for an LLC cooperative:**
- Name Reservation (optional): $10-$45 (depending on processing speed)
- Articles of Organization: $50
- Expedited Processing (optional): $35-$400
- **Minimum State Filing Fees:** $50-$95

**Additional costs may include:**
- Attorney fees for operating agreement drafting
- Statutory agent service (if using professional service): $50-$300/year
- EIN application: Free
- TPT License: $12 per location
- Local business licenses: Varies by municipality
- Publication (if not in Maricopa/Pima County): $50-$200

---

### Q4: Do I need to publish a notice after forming my LLC?

**Probably not, if you're in the Phoenix or Tucson areas.** Effective September 14, 2024, LLCs with statutory agents in Maricopa County or Pima County are exempt from publication requirements. If your statutory agent is in another county, you must publish notice in an ACC-approved newspaper within 60 days of filing and submit an Affidavit of Publication.

---

### Q5: What ongoing compliance requirements exist for Arizona cooperatives?

**Current requirements:**
- **Statutory Agent:** Must maintain continuously; update ACC within 30 days of any change
- **TPT License Renewal:** Annual renewal by January 1 (if you have a TPT license)
- **TPT Filing:** Monthly, quarterly, or annual depending on your tax liability
- **Local Business Licenses:** Renew as required by municipality
- **Annual Reports:** Arizona does not require annual reports for LLCs

---

### Q6: Why did Technicians for Sustainability incorporate in Colorado instead of Arizona?

Technicians for Sustainability, a Tucson-based solar company, converted to a worker cooperative in 2017. They incorporated in **Colorado** because Arizona lacks dedicated worker cooperative statutes. Colorado has a stronger legal framework for worker cooperatives, and TFS followed the model of Namaste Solar (another Colorado worker cooperative solar company) with support from experienced cooperative attorneys in Colorado. This approach allowed them to use proven legal structures while maintaining operations in Arizona.

---

### Q7: Can I convert my existing Arizona business to a worker cooperative?

**Yes.** Common approaches include:
- Restructuring an LLC's operating agreement to incorporate cooperative principles
- Converting between entity types (e.g., sole proprietorship to LLC with cooperative structure)
- Selling the business to a newly formed worker cooperative (which may be structured as an Arizona LLC or an out-of-state cooperative entity)

The Arizona Cooperative Initiative partners with Project Equity to support business conversions. The process typically involves feasibility assessment, business valuation, transition planning, and financing the ownership change.

---

### Q8: What resources exist for cooperative development in Arizona?

**Arizona-specific:**
- **Arizona Cooperative Initiative** - Statewide cooperative development organization
- **Arizona SBDC Network** - Free business advising throughout the state

**National resources serving Arizona:**
- U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives (USFWC)
- Democracy at Work Institute (DAWI)
- NCBA CLUSA
- Project Equity (partner of Arizona Cooperative Initiative)
