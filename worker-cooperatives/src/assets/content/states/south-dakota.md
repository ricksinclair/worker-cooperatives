# How to Start a Worker Cooperative in South Dakota

A comprehensive guide to forming and operating a worker-owned cooperative business in the Mount Rushmore State.

---

## 1. Quick Summary: What Makes South Dakota Unique

South Dakota offers a distinctive environment for worker cooperatives with several notable characteristics:

**No State Income Tax**: South Dakota is one of only nine states with no personal income tax and no corporate income tax. This means worker-owners keep more of their patronage dividends, and the cooperative avoids state-level corporate taxation entirely. According to the [South Dakota Department of Revenue](https://dor.sd.gov/businesses/taxes/), the state does not impose any form of business income tax, providing a uniquely tax-friendly environment for cooperatives.

**Strong Agricultural Cooperative Tradition**: With over 80,000 South Dakotans belonging to cooperatives across agriculture, electric, banking, and telecommunications sectors, the state has deep-rooted cooperative culture. The [South Dakota Association of Cooperatives (SDAC)](https://www.sdac.coop/) has been supporting cooperatives statewide for decades, representing all types of cooperatives from grain elevators to telecommunications providers and creating a supportive ecosystem with broad public familiarity with the cooperative model.

**Business-Friendly Environment**: South Dakota consistently ranks among the most business-friendly states, with minimal regulatory burden, low filing fees ($150 for LLC formation online), and streamlined processes through the [Secretary of State's office](https://sdsos.gov/business-services/default.aspx). Processing times for online filings are typically 1-2 business days.

**Rural and Agricultural Focus**: Many existing support resources are geared toward agricultural and rural cooperatives, which can be advantageous for worker cooperatives in food, farming, and rural industries. Organizations like [Dakota Resources](https://dakotaresources.org/) and [GROW South Dakota](https://www.growsd.org/) provide specialized assistance for rural enterprises.

**Key Consideration**: While South Dakota has well-established cooperative laws ([SDCL Chapters 47-15 through 47-20](https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/47-15)), these statutes were designed primarily for agricultural and traditional cooperatives. The Secretary of State does not provide standard forms for cooperative formation. Many worker cooperatives in South Dakota therefore choose the LLC structure with a cooperative-style operating agreement for greater flexibility and simpler formation.

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives

### Option A: Cooperative Corporation (SDCL Chapters 47-15 to 47-20)

South Dakota's cooperative statutes are found in [Title 47 (Corporations)](https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/47), specifically Chapters 15-20, covering Formation and General Powers, Membership, Stock and Distributions, Directors, Officers and Employees, Reorganization and Dissolution, Foreign Cooperatives, and Records, Accounts and Reports.

**Key Statutory Provisions:**
- **[Chapter 47-15](https://law.justia.com/codes/south-dakota/title-47/chapter-15/)**: Formation and General Powers
- **Chapter 47-16**: Membership, Stock, and Distributions
- **Chapter 47-17**: Directors, Officers, and Employees
- **Chapter 47-18**: Reorganization and Dissolution
- **[SDCL 47-15-41 to 47-15-43](https://law.justia.com/codes/south-dakota/title-47/chapter-15/)**: Governs use of the term "cooperative" (unauthorized use is a petty offense)

**Advantages:**
- Explicitly recognized cooperative structure under South Dakota law
- Clear statutory framework for cooperative principles
- Automatic recognition as a cooperative for tax and regulatory purposes
- Conversion provisions allow existing corporations to become cooperatives ([SDCL 47-15-14](https://law.justia.com/codes/south-dakota/title-47/chapter-15/section-47-15-14/))
- May use "Cooperative" in business name

**Considerations:**
- The [Secretary of State does not provide standard forms](https://sdsos.gov/business-services/corporations/corporate-forms/cooperatives.aspx) for cooperative formation; you must draft your own articles following the statutes
- Statutes are designed primarily for agricultural/consumer cooperatives
- May require more customization for worker cooperative governance
- Professional legal assistance recommended for document preparation

**How to File:**
Contact the [South Dakota Secretary of State Corporations Division](https://sdsos.gov/business-services/corporations/corporate-forms/cooperatives.aspx) for guidance on filing cooperative articles of incorporation. You will need to prepare custom documents in compliance with SDCL 47-15 through 47-20.

### Option B: Limited Liability Company (LLC) with Cooperative Operating Agreement (Recommended for Most Worker Co-ops)

Many worker cooperatives nationwide, including in South Dakota, form as LLCs and establish cooperative governance through their operating agreement. This approach combines the legal simplicity of LLC formation with the flexibility to implement cooperative principles.

**Advantages:**
- Flexible governance structure customizable to worker cooperative principles
- Pass-through taxation by default (avoids double taxation)
- Limited liability protection for all members
- Simpler formation process with [standard forms available](https://sdsos.gov/business-services/corporations/corporate-forms/limited-liability-companies.aspx)
- Can specify "one member, one vote" in the operating agreement
- Lower administrative complexity than cooperative corporation

**Filing Requirements ([per SD Secretary of State](https://sosenterprise.sd.gov/BusinessServices/Business/RegistrationInstr.aspx)):**
- **Filing Fee**: $150 online, $165 by mail (includes $15 paper processing fee)
- **Expedited Processing**: Additional $50 for 2-business-day processing
- **Annual Report**: $50 due on first day of anniversary month
- **Registered Agent**: Required (must be South Dakota resident or registered commercial agent)
- **Processing Time**: 1-2 business days for online filings

**Important Note on Naming**: South Dakota restricts the use of "Cooperative" in LLC names under SDCL 47-15-41. Consider alternatives like "Collective," "Worker-Owned," or simply use your business name with a tagline describing your cooperative structure. Your LLC name must include "Limited Liability Company," "LLC," "L.L.C.," or similar abbreviation.

**Operating Agreement Provisions for Worker Cooperatives:**
Your operating agreement should explicitly include:
- One member, one vote (regardless of capital contribution)
- Member eligibility tied to employment status
- Profit distribution based on labor (patronage) rather than capital
- Democratic election of managers/board
- Procedures for admitting and removing worker-members
- Patronage dividend allocation and distribution policies
- Internal capital account structure

---

### Option C: Cooperative Corporation Under Subchapter T Tax Election

If organized as an LLC taxed as a corporation (by filing IRS Form 8832), or as a cooperative corporation, the entity can elect treatment under [Subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-A/chapter-1/subchapter-T).

**Federal Tax Benefits:**
- Deduct patronage dividends from taxable income at the cooperative level
- Avoid double taxation on distributed earnings
- Worker-owners report patronage dividends on personal returns
- South Dakota's lack of state income tax means no state-level tax on these distributions
- At least 20% of patronage must be paid in cash; remainder can be retained as member equity

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

Converting an existing business to worker ownership can preserve jobs, retain community wealth, and provide an exit strategy for retiring owners.

### Why Consider Conversion?

- **Succession planning**: Approximately 50% of business owners plan to retire in the next decade
- **Employee retention**: Worker-owners have higher job satisfaction and lower turnover
- **Community anchoring**: Worker-owned businesses are less likely to relocate
- **Tax advantages**: Sellers may benefit from favorable tax treatment
- **Legacy preservation**: Maintain company culture and mission

### Conversion Process Overview

**1. Feasibility Assessment**
- Evaluate business financial health
- Assess employee interest and capacity for ownership
- Determine appropriate ownership structure
- Obtain professional business valuation
- Review legal and tax implications

**2. Structure Selection**

According to [research on conversion models](https://jrwiener.com/esops-and-cooperatives-two-options-of-employee-ownership-models-for-your-company/), worker cooperatives are often more suitable than ESOPs for businesses with:
- Fewer than 100 employees
- Annual revenue between $500,000 and $10 million
- Strong workplace culture and employee engagement
- Desire for democratic governance (one member, one vote)

**Cost Comparison:**
- ESOP setup: Approximately $80,000+ plus ongoing administration costs (annual valuations, trustees, administrators)
- Worker cooperative conversion: Typically $10,000-$50,000 depending on complexity

**3. Legal Conversion Steps**

*Option A: Asset Sale*
- New cooperative purchases business assets
- Provides clean break from previous liabilities
- Seller receives cash or note payment
- Cooperative starts with fresh entity

*Option B: Stock/Membership Sale*
- Existing owners sell ownership interests directly to workers
- Can be structured as gradual buyout over time
- May allow seller financing with favorable terms
- Maintains business continuity

*Option C: Corporate Conversion (for existing corporations)*
- [SDCL 47-15-14](https://law.justia.com/codes/south-dakota/title-47/chapter-15/section-47-15-14/) allows conversion of existing South Dakota corporations to cooperatives
- Requires amendment to articles of incorporation electing cooperative status
- Must comply with Chapters 47-15 to 47-20
- Effective upon certificate of amendment from Secretary of State

**4. Financing the Conversion**
- Seller financing (common in cooperative conversions, typically 60-80% of purchase price)
- SBA 7(a) loans (can be used for business acquisitions)
- Cooperative lenders (Shared Capital Cooperative, The Working World)
- Internal financing from member buy-ins
- USDA rural development programs (for eligible rural businesses)
- Combination of multiple sources

### Resources for Conversion

- [Democracy at Work Institute - Conversion Resources](https://institute.coop/topics/conversion)
- [USFWC Co-op Clinic](https://www.usworker.coop/clinic/) - conversion technical assistance
- [Project Equity](https://project-equity.org/) - national conversion assistance organization

## 7. Common Pitfalls in South Dakota

### Legal and Structural Pitfalls

**1. Using "Cooperative" in an LLC Name**
- South Dakota restricts the word "Cooperative" for LLC names under SDCL 47-15-41
- Unauthorized use constitutes a petty offense (SDCL 47-15-42)
- Solution: Use alternatives like "Collective," "Worker-Owned," or describe your structure in marketing materials rather than your legal name

**2. Relying on Agricultural Cooperative Templates**
- South Dakota's cooperative statutes and SDAC resources primarily serve agricultural cooperatives
- Worker cooperative governance needs differ significantly
- Solution: Consult with attorneys or advisors experienced specifically with worker cooperatives; use national resources like USFWC and Democracy at Work Institute

**3. No Standard Cooperative Formation Forms**
- The [Secretary of State does not provide forms](https://sdsos.gov/business-services/corporations/corporate-forms/cooperatives.aspx) for cooperative corporation formation
- Must draft custom documents from scratch
- Solution: Work with an attorney experienced in cooperative law, or use LLC structure with cooperative operating agreement

**4. Inadequate Operating Agreement**
- Failing to clearly establish one-member-one-vote and patronage-based distribution
- Using generic LLC templates without cooperative provisions
- Solution: Have operating agreement reviewed by cooperative-knowledgeable attorney; include all key cooperative principles explicitly; reference ICA model bylaws

### Governance Pitfalls

**5. Insufficient Member Education**
- New worker-owners may not understand cooperative governance and their responsibilities
- Democratic decision-making requires informed participants
- Solution: Implement robust onboarding and ongoing education; use probationary periods before full membership; provide member handbook

**6. Unclear Decision-Making Processes**
- Confusion about which decisions require full membership vote vs. management discretion
- Can lead to frustration and operational delays
- Solution: Clearly delineate decision-making authority in operating agreement/bylaws; create decision matrix

**7. Neglecting Regular Meetings**
- Skipping required member meetings or failing to document decisions
- Can create legal compliance issues and governance problems
- Solution: Establish meeting calendar; keep thorough minutes; follow notice requirements in bylaws

### Financial Pitfalls

**8. Improper Patronage Allocation**
- Allocating profits based on capital rather than labor (violates cooperative principles)
- Inconsistent application of patronage formula
- Solution: Define clear patronage formula based on hours worked, wages, or other labor-based metrics; apply consistently

**9. Subchapter T Compliance Failures**
- Missing deadlines for written notices of allocation (must be within 8.5 months of fiscal year end)
- Failing to pay at least 20% of patronage in cash
- Solution: Work with accountant experienced in cooperative taxation; establish compliance calendar; send timely 1099-PATR forms

**10. Undercapitalization**
- Insufficient member buy-ins or reserve funds
- Not establishing indivisible reserves for long-term stability
- Solution: Require meaningful but achievable member capital contributions; establish retained earnings policy; build collective reserves

### Operational Pitfalls

**11. Ignoring Local Licensing**
- Assuming state formation is sufficient without checking city/county requirements
- South Dakota leaves most licensing to local jurisdictions
- Solution: Contact local clerk's office before launching; verify zoning compliance; check industry-specific requirements

**12. Missing Sales Tax Registration**
- Failing to register with SD Department of Revenue before making taxable sales
- Penalty of at least $10 for late filings, plus interest
- Solution: Register immediately upon formation if selling taxable goods/services; file monthly by the 20th

**13. Workers' Compensation Gaps**
- Not obtaining required workers' compensation insurance before hiring
- Worker-members are typically considered employees for this purpose
- Solution: Secure coverage before operations begin; consult insurance professional familiar with cooperatives

**14. Failing to Maintain Registered Agent**
- Letting registered agent lapse or using invalid address
- Can result in missed legal notices, loss of good standing
- Solution: Maintain current registered agent; file Statement of Change if agent changes ($10 fee); use reliable commercial agent if needed

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q1: Does South Dakota have a specific worker cooperative statute?

**A:** No. South Dakota's cooperative statutes ([SDCL Chapters 47-15 to 47-20](https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/47-15)) are general cooperative laws originally designed for agricultural and consumer cooperatives. They can accommodate worker cooperatives but don't specifically address them. Many worker cooperatives in South Dakota form as LLCs with cooperative operating agreements, which provides more flexibility and simpler formation.

### Q2: How does South Dakota's lack of state income tax benefit worker cooperatives?

**A:** Without state income tax, worker-owners keep more of their patronage dividends (there's no state tax on this income). According to the [SD Department of Revenue](https://dor.sd.gov/businesses/taxes/), South Dakota does not impose any corporate income tax or individual income tax. Cooperatives structured as pass-through entities or those using Subchapter T treatment avoid state-level corporate income tax entirely. This can result in meaningful savings compared to states with income taxes, though other taxes (sales tax, property tax) still apply.

### Q3: Can I use the word "Cooperative" in my LLC name in South Dakota?

**A:** No. South Dakota restricts the use of "Cooperative" (and similar terms like "Credit Union," "Bank," "Trust," "Insurance") in LLC names under SDCL 47-15-41. Unauthorized use is a petty offense. However, you can form as a cooperative corporation under SDCL 47-15 and use the term, or use alternative language for your LLC like "Collective" or "Worker-Owned" in your business name and marketing materials.

### Q4: What is the minimum number of people required to form a worker cooperative in South Dakota?

**A:** South Dakota law does not specify a minimum number of members for cooperatives or LLCs. An LLC can technically be formed by one person. However, practical considerations suggest starting with at least three members to enable democratic governance (avoid tie votes), share responsibilities, and create a genuine cooperative structure. Some national best practices recommend five or more founding members for long-term sustainability.

### Q5: How are worker-owners taxed in South Dakota?

**A:** Worker-owners receive income in two forms: (1) wages for their labor, which are subject to standard employment taxes (Social Security, Medicare, federal income tax withholding), and (2) patronage dividends based on their work contribution, which are reported as ordinary income on federal returns. Since South Dakota has no state income tax, there's no state income tax on either form of compensation. However, workers must pay federal income tax on both wages and patronage distributions.

### Q6: What ongoing compliance requirements does a worker cooperative have in South Dakota?

**A:** Key ongoing requirements include:
- **Annual Report**: File with Secretary of State ($50 for LLCs) on the first day of anniversary month
- **Sales Tax Returns**: Monthly filings if registered for sales tax (returns due by 20th, payment by 25th)
- **Federal Tax Returns**: Annual filing with IRS; Form 1099-PATR for patronage dividends over $10

### Q7: What support is available for worker cooperatives in South Dakota?

**A:** While South Dakota doesn't have dedicated worker cooperative development organizations, several resources can help:
- **[SD SBDC](https://sdbusinesshelp.com/)**: Free business consulting and planning assistance at multiple locations
- **[GROW South Dakota](https://www.growsd.org/)**: Business loans and technical assistance, especially for rural businesses; certified CDFI
- **[Dakota Resources](https://dakotaresources.org/)**: Rural development assistance and CDFI lending
- **[USFWC Co-op Clinic](https://www.usworker.coop/clinic/)**: National technical assistance program specifically for worker cooperatives
- **[SDAC](https://www.sdac.coop/)**: General cooperative networking and advocacy (primarily agricultural focus, but can provide referrals)
- **[USDA Rural Development](https://www.rd.usda.gov/)**: Grants and loans for rural cooperative businesses

### Q8: How does a worker cooperative conversion differ from an ESOP in South Dakota?

**A:** Key differences include:
- **Cost**: Worker cooperative conversions typically cost $10,000-$50,000 vs. $80,000+ for ESOPs plus ongoing annual costs
- **Governance**: Worker cooperatives have one-member-one-vote democratic control; ESOPs are benefit plans where voting rights may be limited to major corporate decisions
- **Best Fit**: Worker cooperatives work well for businesses under 100 employees with $500K-$10M revenue; ESOPs typically suit larger companies with significant assets
- **Ongoing Administration**: Worker cooperatives have lower administrative costs (no annual stock valuations, ESOP trustees, third-party administrators)
- **Tax Treatment**: Both can provide tax advantages, but mechanisms differ; ESOPs have specific IRC Section 1042 benefits for C-corp sellers
- **Regional Support**: The Minnesota/Dakotas ESOP Association chapter can provide resources for both models
