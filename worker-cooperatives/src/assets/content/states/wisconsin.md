A comprehensive guide to forming worker-owned cooperatives in the Badger State.

---

## 1. Quick Summary: What Makes Wisconsin Unique

Wisconsin has one of the **strongest cooperative traditions in the United States**, making it an exceptionally supportive environment for worker cooperatives. Key advantages include:

- **Robust Legal Framework**: Wisconsin offers two dedicated cooperative statutes—[Chapter 185 (Cooperative Corporations)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/185) and [Chapter 193 (Unincorporated Cooperative Associations)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/193)—providing flexibility in entity structure.

- **World-Class Support Ecosystem**: The [University of Wisconsin Center for Cooperatives (UWCC)](https://uwcc.wisc.edu/), established in 1962, has started 26 co-ops in the past five years and is a national leader in cooperative education, research, and development.

- **Vibrant Madison Cooperative Scene**: Madison hosts the [Madison Cooperative Development Coalition (MCDC)](https://www.mcdcmadison.org/), a city-backed initiative providing grants, technical assistance, and cooperative education specifically aimed at addressing income inequality and creating living-wage jobs.

- **728 Cooperatives Statewide**: Wisconsin's cooperative directory demonstrates a thriving ecosystem across all sectors.

- **Legislative Momentum**: In 2025, the Wisconsin Assembly passed [Assembly Bill 17](https://www.thecentersquare.com/wisconsin/article_3d68e24f-1276-497a-87c7-a2cbb65cbcb5.html) with unanimous bipartisan support, creating a $100,000 tax credit for businesses converting to employee ownership and eliminating state capital gains taxes on sales to ESOPs or cooperatives.

- **Strong Technical Assistance Network**: Organizations including [Cooperative Development Services (CDS)](https://www.cdsus.coop/), the [Wisconsin Center for Employee Ownership (WICEO)](https://www.wiceo.org/), and the Wisconsin SBDC network provide hands-on support.

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives in Wisconsin

Wisconsin offers several legal pathways for forming worker cooperatives. Each has distinct advantages depending on your cooperative's goals.

### Option A: Chapter 185 Cooperative Corporation (Recommended for Most Worker Co-ops)

[Wisconsin Statutes Chapter 185](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/185) is the traditional and most commonly used structure for cooperatives in Wisconsin.

**Advantages:**
- Specifically designed for cooperative enterprises
- Clear one-member, one-vote governance structure
- Potential eligibility for Capper-Volstead antitrust exemption
- Potential eligibility for IRC Section 521 tax-exempt status
- Lower filing fees ($25 for non-stock cooperatives)
- Well-established legal precedent and case law

**Requirements:**
- Minimum of five incorporators, at least one Wisconsin resident
- Articles of incorporation filed with [Wisconsin DFI](https://dfi.wi.gov/)
- Annual report filing required

**Best for:** Most worker cooperatives, especially those wanting traditional cooperative governance and potential tax benefits.

### Option B: Chapter 193 Unincorporated Cooperative Association

[Wisconsin Statutes Chapter 193](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/193) provides a more flexible, modern alternative.

**Advantages:**
- More flexibility in governance structure
- Can accommodate both patron and investor members
- Pass-through taxation similar to LLCs
- Easier conversion from existing businesses

**Requirements:**
- At least one patron member required
- If any patron member is an individual, must have at least five individual patron members
- Articles filed with Wisconsin DFI

**Cautions:**
- A Chapter 185 cooperative cannot convert to Chapter 193
- Flexible structures may disqualify the cooperative from certain tax benefits and antitrust exemptions
- Nonpatron members may have buyout rights if governance changes adversely affect them

**Best for:** Hybrid cooperatives seeking investor capital or businesses converting to cooperative ownership.

### Option C: Limited Liability Company (LLC) with Cooperative Operating Agreement

An LLC can be structured cooperatively through its operating agreement.

**Advantages:**
- Pass-through taxation
- Flexible management structure
- More familiar to attorneys and lenders
- $130 online filing fee ($170 by mail)

**Requirements:**
- [Articles of Organization](https://dfi.wi.gov/Pages/BusinessServices/BusinessEntities/Forms.aspx) filed with Wisconsin DFI
- Detailed operating agreement establishing cooperative principles
- Registered agent with Wisconsin physical address

**Cautions:**
- Must explicitly incorporate cooperative principles in operating agreement
- May not be recognized as a "cooperative" for certain programs or benefits
- Less established legal framework for cooperative-specific disputes

**Best for:** Small worker cooperatives wanting simplicity, or groups uncertain about their long-term structure.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Chapter 185 | Chapter 193 | LLC |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Filing Fee | $25-55+ | $25+ | $130-170 |
| Minimum Members | 5 incorporators | 5 individuals | 1 |
| Pass-Through Tax | No (C-corp) | Yes | Yes |
| Cooperative Identity | Strong | Moderate | Weak |
| Tax Exemption Eligibility | Yes | Maybe | No |
| Governance Flexibility | Low | High | High |

### Q3: Do I need an attorney to form a worker cooperative?

**A:** While not legally required, consulting an attorney experienced with cooperatives is strongly recommended. Worker cooperatives have unique governance, taxation, and patronage distribution requirements. The [UWCC](https://uwcc.wisc.edu/resources/legal-taxation-issues/) and [MCDC](https://www.mcdcmadison.org/) can provide referrals to cooperative-experienced attorneys. Many foundational documents require careful drafting to properly implement cooperative principles.

### Q4: How are worker cooperative members taxed in Wisconsin?

**A:** Taxation depends on your structure:
- **Chapter 185 Cooperatives**: Generally taxed as C-corporations, but may qualify for Subchapter T treatment where patronage dividends are deductible
- **Chapter 193 Cooperatives and LLCs**: Pass-through taxation where profits flow to members' individual returns
- Members are taxed on patronage dividends received, whether in cash or allocated to capital accounts

Consult a cooperative-experienced accountant for specific guidance.

### Q5: What free resources are available in Wisconsin?

**A:** Wisconsin offers exceptional free support:
- **[UWCC](https://uwcc.wisc.edu/)**: Co-op development assistance, educational resources, sample documents

- **[Wisconsin SBDC](https://wisconsinsbdc.org/)**: No-cost business consulting, financial projections, loan assistance
- **[WICEO](https://www.wiceo.org/)**: Education and service provider referrals

### Q6: Can an existing business convert to a worker cooperative?

**A:** Yes, and Wisconsin is increasingly supportive of conversions. New legislation (AB 17) provides tax credits of up to $100,000 for conversion costs and eliminates state capital gains taxes on sales to cooperatives. The [UWCC](https://uwcc.wisc.edu/resources/employee-ownership/) and [CDS](https://www.cdsus.coop/) specialize in conversion technical assistance. Conversions typically take 1-3 years and require careful planning, employee education, and professional guidance.

### Q7: What is the difference between Chapter 185 and Chapter 193 cooperatives?

**A:** Key differences include:

| Aspect | Chapter 185 | Chapter 193 |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Entity Type | Corporation | Unincorporated Association |
| Taxation | C-corp (Subchapter T eligible) | Pass-through |
| Flexibility | Traditional cooperative structure | Can include investor members |
| Tax Benefits | May qualify for IRC 521 | May lose tax benefits |
| Conversion | Cannot convert to Ch. 193 | Businesses can convert to Ch. 193 |

Most traditional worker cooperatives use Chapter 185. Chapter 193 may be appropriate for hybrid structures or conversions needing investor capital.

### Q8: Where can I find examples of successful Wisconsin worker cooperatives?

**A:** Notable Wisconsin worker cooperatives include:
- **[Union Cab of Madison](https://www.unioncab.com/)**: Madison's largest taxi fleet since the 1970s
