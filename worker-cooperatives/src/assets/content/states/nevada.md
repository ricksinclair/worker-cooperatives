A comprehensive guide to forming and operating a worker-owned cooperative business in the Silver State.

---

## Quick Summary: What Makes Nevada Unique for Worker Cooperatives

Nevada offers a distinctive business environment for worker cooperatives with several key advantages:

- **No State Income Tax**: Nevada has no personal or corporate income tax, meaning worker-owners keep more of their patronage dividends and profit distributions. This can be a significant advantage for cooperative members compared to neighboring states.

- **Dedicated Worker Cooperative Statutes**: Nevada is one of the few states with specific statutory provisions for worker cooperatives under [NRS Chapter 81 (Sections 81.913-81.959)](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-081.html), providing a clear legal framework for worker-owned businesses.

- **Business-Friendly Environment**: Nevada is known for its flexible business laws, minimal regulatory burden, and strong privacy protections for business owners.

- **Flexible LLC Laws**: Nevada's [NRS Chapter 86](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-086.html) provides highly flexible LLC statutes, allowing cooperatives to structure themselves as LLCs with customized operating agreements that reflect cooperative principles.

- **Commerce Tax Instead of Corporate Tax**: Businesses only pay the [Commerce Tax](https://tax.nv.gov/Commerce/ComTaxRegistrationFAQs/) if Nevada gross revenue exceeds $4 million annually, and rates range from just 0.051% to 0.331% depending on industry.

- **Growing Regional Support**: Nevada is part of the [Accelerate Employee Ownership initiative](https://project-equity.org/press-releases/project-equity-and-shared-capital-cooperative-launch-accelerate-employee-ownership-to-retain-small-businesses-and-advance-quality-jobs/) covering California, Nevada, and Arizona, providing access to specialized conversion support and financing.

## Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives in Nevada

Nevada offers multiple legal pathways for forming a worker cooperative. Here are the primary options:

### Option 1: Worker Cooperative Corporation (NRS 81.913-81.959)

Nevada has dedicated statutory provisions for worker cooperative corporations, making this a strong choice for groups seeking a well-defined legal framework.

**Key Features:**
- **Election Process**: An existing Nevada corporation can elect to be governed as a worker cooperative under [NRS 81.919](https://law.justia.com/codes/nevada/chapter-81/)
- **Membership**: [NRS 81.929](https://law.justia.com/codes/nevada/chapter-81/) allows the cooperative to establish qualifications and methods for acceptance, expulsion, termination, and suspension of members
- **Earnings Distribution**: [NRS 81.921](https://law.justia.com/codes/nevada/chapter-81/) governs the apportionment and distribution of net earnings and losses
- **Internal Capital Accounts**: [NRS 81.923](https://law.justia.com/codes/nevada/chapter-81/) and [NRS 81.927](https://law.justia.com/codes/nevada/chapter-81/) address internal capital accounts and collective reserve accounts
- **Governance**: [NRS 81.931](https://law.justia.com/codes/nevada/chapter-81/) specifies board of directors composition and member authority to override board decisions
- **Meeting Requirements**: [NRS 81.939](https://law.justia.com/codes/nevada/chapter-81/statute-81-939/) requires written notice 10-90 days before member meetings

**Best For:** Groups wanting a clearly defined cooperative structure with statutory backing for democratic governance and patronage-based distributions.

### Option 2: Cooperative LLC

Nevada's flexible LLC laws under [NRS Chapter 86](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-086.html) allow you to structure an LLC with cooperative principles embedded in the operating agreement.

**Key Features:**
- **Operating Agreement Flexibility**: While Nevada does not legally require an operating agreement, you can create one that establishes one-member-one-vote governance, membership requirements, and patronage-based profit sharing
- **Member-Managed or Manager-Managed**: Choose the management structure that fits your cooperative's needs
- **Pass-Through Taxation**: LLCs offer partnership taxation by default, which can be advantageous for cooperatives
- **Lower Filing Costs**: LLC formation may have lower ongoing costs compared to corporations

**Best For:** Smaller cooperatives, startups, or groups wanting maximum flexibility in designing their governance structure.

### Option 3: Cooperative Association (NRS 81.170-81.270)

Nevada also provides for traditional cooperative associations under the general cooperative provisions of NRS Chapter 81.

**Key Features:**
- **No Capital Stock**: Under [NRS 81.180](https://law.justia.com/codes/nevada/2010/title7/chapter81/nrs81-180.html), cooperative associations do not have or issue capital stock but issue membership certificates
- **Five or More Persons**: Formation requires five or more persons
- **Membership Certificates**: Non-transferable except by board resolution

**Best For:** Traditional cooperatives focused on mutual benefit rather than pure worker ownership.

### Comparison Table

## Worker-Ownership Conversions

Converting an existing business to worker ownership can preserve jobs, retain local businesses, and create wealth-building opportunities for employees.

### Is Your Business Ready for Conversion?

According to [Project Equity](https://project-equity.org/news/employee-ownership-insider/ready-for-worker-cooperative-transition/), ideal conversion candidates have:

- **Stability**: Ability to cover buy-out costs even during business cycle downturns
- **Engaged Workforce**: Employees interested in ownership and profit-sharing
- **Manageable Size**: Worker cooperatives work well for any size, but are particularly cost-effective for smaller businesses where ESOPs may be too complex or expensive

### The Conversion Timeline

Conversions typically take 6 months to several years and include:

1. **Feasibility Assessment**: Evaluate business value, employee interest, and structural options
2. **Business Valuation**: Establish fair market value for the business
3. **Deal Structure**: Determine financing mix (seller financing, bank loans, member equity, CDFI loans)
4. **Legal Restructuring**: Form cooperative entity, transfer assets/ownership
5. **Governance Development**: Create bylaws, train worker-owners
6. **Implementation**: Close the transaction, begin operations as a cooperative

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q1: Does Nevada have specific laws for worker cooperatives?

**Yes.** Nevada has dedicated worker cooperative corporation statutes under [NRS 81.913-81.959](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-081.html). These provisions address how a corporation can elect to be governed as a worker cooperative, membership requirements, earnings distribution, internal capital accounts, board governance, and more. This makes Nevada one of the states with clearer legal pathways for worker cooperative formation.

### Q2: Should I form a corporation or LLC for my worker cooperative?

**It depends on your needs.** If you want the specific statutory protections and framework of Nevada's worker cooperative laws, form a corporation and elect worker cooperative status under NRS 81.919. If you prefer maximum flexibility in designing your governance structure, a cooperative LLC may be better. LLCs are generally simpler to form and maintain, while corporations have more established legal precedent. Consider consulting with an attorney familiar with cooperative business structures.

- Local business licenses: varies by jurisdiction
- EIN: Free from the IRS

### Q4: Does Nevada have a state income tax on cooperative distributions?

**No.** Nevada has no personal income tax and no corporate income tax. This means worker-owners do not pay state income tax on their patronage dividends or profit distributions.
