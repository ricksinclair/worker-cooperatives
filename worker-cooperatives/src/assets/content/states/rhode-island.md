---

## Quick Summary: What Makes Rhode Island Unique

Rhode Island stands out as one of the most worker-cooperative-friendly states in New England, offering several distinct advantages for cooperative entrepreneurs:

### Small State Advantages

**Dedicated Statutory Framework**: Rhode Island is one of the few states with a dedicated [Workers' Cooperatives statute (Chapter 7-6.2)](https://law.justia.com/codes/rhode-island/title-7/chapter-7-6-2/) enacted in 2017, providing clear legal recognition and governance guidelines specifically tailored for worker-owned enterprises.

**Compact Geography**: As the smallest U.S. state, Rhode Island offers unparalleled access to state agencies, legislators, and support organizations. Providence to any corner of the state is under an hour's drive, making networking and collaboration remarkably efficient.

**Active Cooperative Ecosystem**: Despite being the smallest state, Rhode Island boasts a thriving worker cooperative movement anchored by organizations like the [Rhode Island Worker Cooperative Alliance (RIWCA)](https://riworkercoop.org/), the [Rhode Island Center for Employee Ownership (RICEO)](https://riceo.org/), and support from groups like [Fuerza Laboral](https://www.fuerza-laboral.org) and [Co-op Rhody](https://cooprhody.org).

**Strategic Regional Position**: Rhode Island benefits from proximity to the established cooperative ecosystems in Boston and Western Massachusetts, with access to resources from organizations like the [Cooperative Fund of New England (CFNE)](https://cooperativefund.org/) and the [Cooperative Development Institute](https://cdi.coop/).

**Cannabis Cooperative Licenses**: When Rhode Island legalized recreational cannabis, six licenses were specifically reserved for worker-owned cooperative dispensaries, creating new pathways for cooperative entrepreneurship.

**No General Business License**: Rhode Island does not require a general state business license, reducing initial administrative burden for new cooperatives.

## Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Cooperatives in Rhode Island

Rhode Island offers multiple pathways for structuring a worker cooperative, with the dedicated worker cooperative statute being the most direct route.

### Option 1: Workers' Cooperative Corporation (Chapter 7-6.2) - Recommended

Rhode Island's [Workers' Cooperatives statute (R.I. Gen. Laws Chapter 7-6.2)](https://law.justia.com/codes/rhode-island/title-7/chapter-7-6-2/) provides a purpose-built legal framework for worker-owned businesses. This structure is available to corporations organized under Rhode Island's general corporation law that elect to be governed as a workers' cooperative.

**Key Statutory Provisions:**

| Section | Topic | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 7-6.2-2 | Definitions | Defines workers' cooperative, member, membership share, patronage, and related terms |
| 7-6.2-3 | Election | Corporations may elect to be governed as workers' cooperatives |
| 7-6.2-4 | Application of law | Applies general corporation law; addresses business corporation taxes |
| 7-6.2-5 | Revocation | Procedures for revoking workers' cooperative election |
| 7-6.2-6 | Membership | Member rights, membership shares, fees, and responsibilities |
| 7-6.2-7 | Voting | Voting shares, bylaws, and certificate amendments |
| 7-6.2-8 | Earnings | Apportionment and distribution of net earnings or losses based on patronage |
| 7-6.2-9 | Governance | Director and officer requirements |
| 7-6.2-10 | Capital | Internal capital accounts, share redemption, interest, and collective reserves |
| 7-6.2-11 | Conversion | Procedures for mergers, consolidation, and revocation |

**Key Definition - Patronage**: Under Chapter 7-6.2, "patronage" means the amount of work performed as a member of a workers' cooperative, measured in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

**Advantages:**
- Clear legal framework designed specifically for worker cooperatives
- Established governance requirements with statutory backing
- Defined procedures for internal capital accounts and profit distribution
- Legal precedent and recognition in Rhode Island
- Legitimacy with lenders and partners

**Considerations:**
- Subject to corporate tax (7% of net income or $400 minimum)
- More formal governance requirements
- Annual report required by March 1

### Option 2: Worker-Owned Limited Liability Company (LLC)

While Rhode Island's Chapter 7-6.2 statute specifically applies to corporations, many worker cooperatives successfully operate as LLCs with customized operating agreements that incorporate cooperative principles.

**Filing Requirements:**
- [Articles of Organization (Form 400)](https://docs.sos.ri.gov/documents/BusinessServices/400-articles-of-organization.pdf): $150 filing fee
- Operating agreement (not legally required, but essential for cooperatives)
- Annual report: $50, due between September 1 and November 1

**Advantages:**
- Lower formation costs
- Greater flexibility in structuring ownership and governance
- Pass-through taxation simplifies tax compliance
- Operating agreement can be tailored to cooperative principles
- Less formal ongoing requirements

**Creating a Cooperative Operating Agreement:**

Your operating agreement should include:
- Democratic voting rights (one member, one vote)
- Membership eligibility requirements tied to employment
- Patronage-based profit distribution
- Internal capital account procedures
- Buy-out provisions when members leave
- Decision-making and governance procedures

**Important Note:** When structuring an LLC as a worker cooperative, consult with an attorney experienced in cooperative business structures to ensure your operating agreement properly reflects cooperative principles while complying with Rhode Island law.

### Option 3: Subchapter T Tax Election

Both corporations and LLCs can elect treatment under IRS Subchapter T, which provides favorable tax treatment for patronage dividends.

**Key Benefits:**
- Deduct patronage dividends from taxable income
- Members taxed on their allocated share of earnings
- Reduces or eliminates entity-level taxation on distributed profits

**Requirements:**
- Operate on a cooperative basis
- Distribute earnings based on patronage (work performed)
- Meet IRS requirements for cooperative status

### Comparison Table: Legal Structure Options

| Feature | Chapter 7-6.2 Worker Coop | Cooperative LLC |
|---------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Formation Fee** | $150-$230 | $150 |
| **Annual Report Fee** | $20 (due March 1) | $50 (due Sept-Nov) |
| **Minimum Annual Tax** | $400 | $400 |
| **Taxation** | Corporate (7%) or Subchapter T | Pass-through or Subchapter T |
| **Statutory Framework** | Dedicated worker coop statute | General LLC law |
| **Democratic Governance** | Required by statute | Must be in Operating Agreement |
| **Complexity** | Moderate | Lower |

### Special Naming Requirement

If you want to use "cooperative" in your business name, Rhode Island requires a special permit. Contact the [Rhode Island Secretary of State Business Services Division](https://www.sos.ri.gov/divisions/business-services) for the permit application process.

### Additional Entity Options

Rhode Island also recognizes several other cooperative structures:
- **Cooperative Housing Corporations** (Chapter 7-6.1)
- **Producers' Cooperatives** (Chapter 7-7)
- **Consumers' Cooperatives** (Chapter 7-8)
- **L3C (Low-Profit Limited Liability Company)**: For cooperatives with social missions

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for Rhode Island

### 1. Does Rhode Island have a specific law for worker cooperatives?

Yes. Rhode Island enacted [Chapter 7-6.2 of the General Laws](https://law.justia.com/codes/rhode-island/title-7/chapter-7-6-2/) specifically governing Workers' Cooperatives in 2017 (effective January 1, 2018). This statute allows corporations organized under general corporation law to elect to be governed as workers' cooperatives, with provisions for membership, voting, profit distribution, internal capital accounts, and governance. This makes Rhode Island one of the relatively few states with a dedicated worker cooperative statute.

### 2. Can I form a worker cooperative as an LLC in Rhode Island?

Yes. While Chapter 7-6.2 specifically applies to corporations, many successful worker cooperatives operate as LLCs with operating agreements that incorporate cooperative principles (democratic governance, membership tied to employment, patronage-based profit sharing). Rhode Island does not legally require an operating agreement, giving you flexibility to customize governance. Consider consulting an attorney experienced in cooperative law to ensure your operating agreement properly establishes cooperative principles.

### 3. How much does it cost to form a worker cooperative in Rhode Island?

Basic formation costs include:

| Cost Category | Amount |
|---------------|--------|
| Articles of Organization (LLC) | $150 |
| Articles of Incorporation (Corp) | $150-$230 |
| Name Reservation (optional) | $50 |
| Registered Agent (if using service) | $50-200/year |
| Annual Report | $50 (LLC) / $20 (Corp) |
| Minimum Annual Tax | $400/year |

Total first-year costs: Approximately $600-$850 for basic state filings, plus legal fees for drafting governing documents (typically $2,000-$10,000 depending on complexity).

### 4. What organizations in Rhode Island can help me start a worker cooperative?

Rhode Island has a robust support ecosystem:

- **[Rhode Island Worker Cooperative Alliance (RIWCA)](https://riworkercoop.org/)**: Peer support and networking among existing cooperatives
- **[Rhode Island Center for Employee Ownership (RICEO)](https://riceo.org/)**: Technical assistance and resource connections
- **[Rhode Island SBDC](https://web.uri.edu/risbdc/)**: Free business counseling at URI and Bryant University
- **[Fuerza Laboral](https://www.fuerza-laboral.org)**: POWER Network Co-op Incubator
- **[Cooperative Fund of New England](https://cooperativefund.org/)**: Financing and technical assistance
- **[Cooperative Development Institute](https://cdi.coop/)**: Regional cooperative development center

### 5. How do worker cooperatives in Rhode Island pay taxes?

Worker cooperatives can elect Subchapter T treatment under the Internal Revenue Code, allowing them to deduct patronage dividends paid to members from taxable income, effectively reducing or eliminating entity-level taxation on distributed profits. Rhode Island treats cooperatives under standard business corporation tax rules (Section 7-6.2-4). Key tax obligations:

- **Minimum Annual Tax**: $400 for all LLCs, LPs, LLPs, and corporations (regardless of profit)
- **Corporate Tax**: 7% of net income or $400 minimum, whichever is greater
- **Pass-through entities** (LLCs taxed as partnerships): File Form RI-1065 and pay $400 annual charge

Consult with an accountant experienced in cooperative taxation for your specific situation.

### 6. Can I convert my existing business to a worker cooperative in Rhode Island?

Yes. Business conversion to worker ownership is a viable succession strategy. Several organizations provide support:

- [Rhode Island Center for Employee Ownership](https://riceo.org/) provides guidance and connections
- [Cooperative Development Institute](https://cdi.coop/) has led 33+ business transitions in New England
- [Cooperative Fund of New England](https://cooperativefund.org/) provides financing for conversions

The CUPS/White Electric Coffee conversion provides a successful Rhode Island model, demonstrating how crowdfunding, cooperative financing, and community support can facilitate worker buyouts.

### 7. Are there financing options specifically for worker cooperatives in Rhode Island?

Yes, several mission-driven lenders specialize in cooperative financing:

- **[Cooperative Fund of New England (CFNE)](https://cooperativefund.org/)**: Regional CDFI with strong track record financing Rhode Island cooperatives
- **[Shared Capital Cooperative](https://sharedcapital.coop/)**: National cooperative loan fund with Worker Ownership Loan Fund
- **[The Working World](https://www.theworkingworld.org/)**: Non-extractive lending for cooperative startups and conversions
- **Navigant Credit Union**: Rhode Island credit union that has worked with local cooperatives

Traditional lenders may be less familiar with cooperative structures, making these specialized institutions valuable partners.

### 8. What are the annual compliance requirements for a worker cooperative in Rhode Island?

Annual compliance requirements include:

| Requirement | Deadline | Agency |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| LLC Annual Report | September 1 - November 1 | Secretary of State |
| Corporate Annual Report | By March 1 | Secretary of State |
| Minimum Annual Tax ($400) | With tax return | Division of Taxation |
