# How to Open a Worker Cooperative in Tennessee

A comprehensive guide to forming and operating a worker-owned cooperative business in the State of Tennessee.

---

## 1. Quick Summary

**What makes Tennessee unique for worker cooperatives:**

Tennessee offers a distinctive business environment for worker cooperatives, highlighted by its **lack of state income tax on wages and salaries**. This tax advantage, combined with a business-friendly regulatory climate and emerging legislative support for employee ownership, makes Tennessee an attractive location for worker-owned enterprises seeking to maximize member distributions and patronage dividends.

**Key distinguishing features:**

- **No state income tax on wages or salaries** - Tennessee does not tax earned income, which can benefit worker-owners receiving W-2 compensation
- **New Employee Ownership Tax Credits (2026)** - [SB 40/HB 1047](https://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/114/Fiscal/SB0040.pdf) creates excise tax credits for businesses converting to employee ownership (ESOPs, EOTs, or worker cooperatives) effective January 1, 2026 through December 31, 2030
- **Tennessee Processing Cooperative Law** ([TCA Title 43, Chapter 38](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/title-43/chapter-38/)) - Provides a statutory cooperative framework with comprehensive provisions for formation, governance, and operations
- **Cooperative Marketing Associations statute** ([TCA Title 43, Chapter 16](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/title-43/chapter-16/)) - Additional cooperative structure option with antitrust protections
- **Flexible LLC statute** - The [Tennessee Revised Limited Liability Company Act](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/title-48/limited-liability-companies/) allows for member-managed, manager-managed, or director-managed structures adaptable to cooperative principles
- **Active employee ownership ecosystem** - The [Tennessee Center for Employee Ownership (TNCEO)](https://www.tnceo.org/) and [Southeast Center for Cooperative Development](https://www.co-opsnow.org/) provide dedicated resources
- **Franchise and excise tax applies** - LLCs and corporations must pay Tennessee's franchise tax (0.25% of net worth, minimum $100) and excise tax (6.5% of net income with $50,000 deduction)
- **Tennessee Works Tax Act relief** - Beginning 2024, small businesses benefit from a $50,000 standard deduction against net earnings for excise tax

**Common entity choices for worker coops in Tennessee:**

1. **Limited Liability Company (LLC)** with cooperative operating agreement - Most popular choice for flexibility and pass-through taxation
2. **Corporation** with cooperative bylaws - Can elect Subchapter T treatment for cooperative tax benefits
3. **Processing Cooperative** (TCA 43-38) - Dedicated cooperative statute, primarily designed for agricultural cooperatives but available for other types
4. **Cooperative Marketing Association** (TCA 43-16) - Available option with antitrust protections

## 2. Best-Fit Legal Structures for Worker Coops in Tennessee

### Option A: LLC with Cooperative Operating Agreement (Most Common)

**Statutory Authority:** [Tennessee Revised Limited Liability Company Act (TCA Title 48, Chapters 201-249)](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/title-48/limited-liability-companies/)

Tennessee's LLC statute, effective January 1, 2006, provides substantial flexibility for structuring a worker cooperative. Under [TCA 48-206-101](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/title-48/limited-liability-companies/chapter-206/section-48-206-101/), an operating agreement may contain any rules regarding the management, governance, and conduct of business, providing the flexibility needed to implement cooperative principles.

**Management Structure Options:**

1. **Member-Managed:** All members have equal management rights - aligns well with small worker cooperatives where all worker-owners participate in governance
2. **Manager-Managed:** Designated managers handle operations - useful for larger cooperatives with elected management
3. **Director-Managed:** Operates like a corporation with a board of directors - ideal for cooperatives wanting traditional board governance while maintaining LLC flexibility

**Key Operating Agreement Provisions for Cooperative LLCs:**

The operating agreement is the binding contract between LLC members that formalizes agreements on governance, voting, profit distribution, and dissolution. Key provisions include:

- **Democratic Voting:** Establish one-member-one-vote regardless of capital contribution
- **Patronage-Based Distributions:** Specify profits distributed based on hours worked or labor contribution
- **Membership Classes:** Define worker-member requirements, rights, and obligations
- **Capital Account Structure:** Create internal capital accounts for member equity tracking
- **Buyback Provisions:** Terms for redeeming member interests upon departure or termination

**Formation Requirements:**

- File [Articles of Organization](https://sos.tn.gov/businesses) with Tennessee Secretary of State
- **Filing Fee:** $50 per member (minimum $300, maximum $3,000)
- **County Recording Required:** Must record a copy with the Register of Deeds in the county where the principal office is located
- Appoint a registered agent with a physical Tennessee address per [TCA 48-249-109](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/title-48/limited-liability-companies/)

**Advantages:**
- Maximum flexibility in governance structure
- Pass-through taxation (avoids corporate double taxation)
- Less formal ongoing compliance requirements
- Can elect to be taxed as a corporation for Subchapter T treatment if desired

**Considerations:**
- Cannot use "cooperative" in entity name without potential confusion
- Must carefully draft operating agreement to achieve cooperative principles
- No dedicated statutory guidance for cooperative-specific issues
- Still subject to Tennessee franchise and excise taxes

---

### Option B: Corporation with Cooperative Bylaws

**Statutory Authority:** [Tennessee Business Corporation Act (TCA Title 48, Chapters 11-27)](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/title-48/)

A Tennessee corporation can be structured to operate as a worker cooperative through carefully drafted bylaws and articles of incorporation, and can elect [Subchapter T tax treatment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-A/chapter-1/subchapter-T) with the IRS.

**Key Corporate Provisions for Worker Cooperatives:**

- **Articles of Incorporation:** Include cooperative purpose, one-member-one-vote provisions, and patronage allocation language
- **Bylaws:** Detail membership requirements, democratic governance, board structure, and profit distribution based on patronage
- **Stock Structure:** Issue membership shares representing equal voting rights

**Subchapter T Benefits:**

If properly structured, the cooperative can [deduct patronage dividends](https://www.wegnercpas.com/worker-co-ops-operating-under-subchapter-t-and-the-new-tax-law/) distributed to members, reducing corporate-level taxation. Key requirements per [26 U.S. Code Subchapter T](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title26/subtitleA/chapter1/subchapterT&edition=prelim):

- Operate on a cooperative basis (one member, one vote)
- Allocate net margins based on patronage (labor contribution)
- Distribute patronage dividends within IRS timelines (8.5 months after fiscal year end)
- Maintain proper documentation of member patronage
- Pay at least 20% of patronage dividends in cash

**Formation Requirements:**

- File Charter (Articles of Incorporation) with Tennessee Secretary of State
- **Filing Fee:** $100 minimum
- File copy with county Register of Deeds if principal office is in Tennessee
- Appoint registered agent with physical Tennessee address

**Advantages:**
- Clear corporate structure familiar to lenders and investors
- Subchapter T tax treatment available for qualifying cooperatives
- Established case law and statutory guidance

**Considerations:**
- Corporate formalities required (annual meetings, minutes, board elections)
- Subject to Tennessee franchise and excise taxes
- More complex compliance than LLC structure

## 6. Worker-Ownership Conversions

### Overview

Tennessee has approximately [110 employee-owned companies](https://www.tnceo.org/employee-ownership-101), with various structures including ESOPs, worker cooperatives, and Employee Ownership Trusts. Business conversions represent a significant opportunity as baby boomer business owners retire.

### New Tennessee Tax Incentives for Conversions

**SB 40/HB 1047 - Employee Ownership Conversion Tax Credits**

Tennessee has enacted [legislation](https://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/114/Fiscal/SB0040.pdf) creating excise tax credits for businesses converting to employee ownership:
- **Effective:** Tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2026 but prior to January 1, 2031
- **Applies to:** ESOP, Employee Ownership Trust (EOT), or Worker-Owned Cooperative (WOC) conversions
- **Benefits:** Credits cover a portion of conversion costs, realized in the year conversion is complete
- **Additional benefit:** Exemption from business tax for qualifying employee-owned businesses

### Conversion Options

**Worker Cooperative Conversion:**

Converting an existing business to worker ownership through a cooperative offers several benefits:
- Preserves jobs and community economic anchors
- Existing customer base, assets, and trained employees reduce startup risk
- Seller may defer capital gains using [Section 1042 rollover](https://www.esop.org/) (for C-corporations selling 30%+ to qualified cooperative)
- Generally lower implementation costs than ESOPs
- More feasible for smaller businesses
- Democratic governance through one-member-one-vote

**Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP):**

For larger companies (typically 20+ employees):
- Federally regulated employee benefit plan
- Significant tax advantages for sellers and companies
- 100% ESOP S-corporations can operate free of federal income taxes on profit
- Higher implementation and maintenance costs
- Requires ongoing compliance with ERISA regulations
- Generally cost-prohibitive for companies with less than $5M in revenue or $1M in payroll

**Employee Ownership Trust (EOT):**

A newer option gaining traction:
- Trust holds shares on behalf of employees
- Can provide perpetual employee ownership
- Less regulatory complexity than ESOPs
- Eligible for Tennessee tax credits starting 2026

**Comparison for Tennessee Businesses:**

| Factor | Worker Cooperative | ESOP | EOT |
|--------|-------------------|------|-----|
| Ideal Company Size | 5-50 employees | 20+ employees | 10+ employees |
| Setup Cost | $10,000-50,000 | $50,000-150,000+ | $25,000-75,000 |
| Annual Maintenance | Lower | Higher (ERISA) | Moderate |
| Democratic Control | One member, one vote | Varies by design | Trustee oversight |
| Tax Benefits | Subchapter T, 1042 | 1042, S-Corp ESOP | State credits (2026+) |
| Governance | Worker-controlled | Trustee-controlled | Trust-managed |

### Conversion Process

## 7. Common Pitfalls in Tennessee

### Legal and Formation Issues

**1. Choosing the Wrong Entity Structure**

Many entrepreneurs are unsure whether to form as an LLC, corporation, or cooperative entity. Consider:
- Tax implications (pass-through vs. Subchapter T)
- Governance flexibility needs
- Future growth and financing plans
- Consult with an attorney and CPA before deciding

**2. Inadequate Operating Agreement or Bylaws**

Worker cooperative bylaws and operating agreements should:
- Contain ready answers for important governance questions
- Codify democratic values and practices
- Provide structure for growth
- Serve as last resort for conflict resolution
- Outlast the founding members
- Be reviewed by a cooperative-familiar attorney

**3. Neglecting County Recording Requirement**

Tennessee requires recording formation documents with the county Register of Deeds if your principal office is in Tennessee. Failure to do so may affect your legal standing.

**4. Failing to Include Required Language**

For Processing Cooperatives, documents must clearly state they are filed pursuant to the Tennessee Processing Cooperative Law per [TCA 43-38-1101](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2020/title-43/chapter-38/part-11/section-43-38-1101/).

### Tax and Compliance Issues

**5. Underestimating Franchise and Excise Tax**

Unlike states with no business-level taxes, Tennessee requires:
- Franchise tax (0.25% of net worth, minimum $100)
- Excise tax (6.5% of net income with $50,000 deduction)
- These apply to LLCs and corporations
- Electronic filing is mandatory

**6. Misunderstanding the "No Income Tax" Advantage**

While Tennessee has no state income tax on wages:
- Businesses still pay franchise and excise taxes
- Patronage dividends may have different treatment
- Consult a Tennessee CPA for complete tax planning

**7. Missing Business License Requirements**

Tennessee's tiered licensing system based on gross receipts:
- Under $3,000: No license required
- $3,000-$100,000: Minimum activity license needed ($15)
- Over $100,000: Standard business license required ($15 each for county and city)
- Failure to obtain proper licensing can result in penalties

**8. Not Registering Before Doing Business**

Per [Tennessee Department of Revenue](https://www.tn.gov/revenue/taxes/business-tax/registration-and-licensing.html), you must submit a fully completed registration application in a timely manner to be properly registered for all applicable taxes. Registration takes up to 10 business days.

### Governance and Operations Issues

**9. Confusing Ownership with Daily Management**

Worker cooperatives should distinguish between:
- **Ownership decisions:** Member votes on major policies, board elections
- **Management decisions:** Day-to-day operations, hiring, purchasing
- Clear role definition prevents decision-making gridlock

**10. "Going Rogue" Problem**

Cooperatives often move slower than sole-owner businesses. When frustrated members bypass democratic processes:
- It undermines cooperative culture
- Creates accountability issues
- Can lead to conflict and member departures
- Solution: Establish clear decision-making levels and accountability structures

**11. Ignoring Employment Law Requirements**

Worker-owners are still employees under federal and state law:
- Minimum wage requirements apply
- Workers' compensation insurance required (5+ employees)
- Unemployment insurance obligations
- Properly document W-2 wages for each member

**12. Insufficient Capitalization**

Startup worker cooperatives often face capital challenges:
- Worker-owners may have limited personal resources
- Traditional lenders may be unfamiliar with cooperative model
- Underestimating working capital needs
- Solution: Develop realistic financial projections and explore cooperative-friendly lenders like the NET Fund

## 8. FAQs for Tennessee

### Q1: Does Tennessee have a specific worker cooperative statute?

**A:** Tennessee does not have a dedicated worker cooperative statute like some states (California, Colorado, etc.). However, worker cooperatives can form under:
- The **Tennessee Revised Limited Liability Company Act** ([TCA 48-249](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/title-48/limited-liability-companies/)) as an LLC with cooperative operating agreement
- The **Tennessee Business Corporation Act** as a corporation with cooperative bylaws
- The **Tennessee Processing Cooperative Law** ([TCA 43-38](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/title-43/chapter-38/)), though primarily designed for agricultural cooperatives
- The **Cooperative Marketing Associations statute** ([TCA 43-16](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/title-43/chapter-16/))

Most Tennessee worker cooperatives choose the LLC structure for its flexibility and tax advantages.

### Q2: What are the ongoing tax obligations for a worker cooperative in Tennessee?

**A:** Tennessee worker cooperatives structured as LLCs or corporations must pay:
- **Franchise Tax:** 0.25% of Tennessee-apportioned net worth (minimum $100)
- **Excise Tax:** 6.5% of net income (with $50,000 deduction)
- **Business Tax:** Based on gross receipts if over $3,000
- **Sales Tax:** If selling taxable goods or services
- **Federal Taxes:** Depending on structure (Subchapter T, partnership, S-Corp)

Sole proprietors and general partnerships are NOT subject to franchise and excise tax. While Tennessee has no state income tax on wages, these business-level taxes still apply.

### Q3: How much does it cost to form a worker cooperative in Tennessee?

**A:** Typical formation costs include:
- **LLC Articles of Organization:** $50 per member (minimum $300, maximum $3,000)
- **Corporation Charter:** $100 minimum
- **County Recording:** Varies by county ($10-50 typically)
- **Name Reservation (optional):** $20
- **Registered Agent:** $0 (if using member) to $100-300/year (commercial service)
- **EIN:** Free
- **Legal Fees:** $2,000-10,000+ depending on complexity
- **Business License:** $15-30

Budget $3,000-15,000+ for complete formation including legal assistance.

### Q4: Can worker-owners avoid payroll taxes by taking all income as patronage dividends?

**A:** No. The IRS requires that worker-owners receive "reasonable compensation" as W-2 wages subject to payroll taxes. Only amounts exceeding reasonable compensation can be distributed as patronage dividends. Per [Subchapter T requirements](https://ahclaw.com/benefit-post/maintaining-cooperative-status-under-subchapter-t-requirements-and-best-practices/), at least 20% of patronage dividends must be paid in cash, and distributions must occur within 8.5 months of fiscal year end. Document your compensation methodology to defend against IRS scrutiny.

### Q5: What is the difference between an ESOP, worker cooperative, and EOT?

**A:** Key differences include:

| Feature | Worker Cooperative | ESOP | EOT |
|---------|-------------------|------|-----|
| Governance | Democratic (one member, one vote) | Trustee-controlled | Trust-managed |
| Regulation | State business law | Federal ERISA | State trust law |
| Best For | Smaller businesses (5-50) | Larger businesses (20+) | Mid-size businesses |
| Setup Cost | $10,000-50,000 | $50,000-150,000+ | $25,000-75,000 |
| Tax Status | Subchapter T | Qualified retirement plan | State credits (2026+) |

Tennessee has approximately 110 employee-owned companies. Contact [TNCEO](https://www.tnceo.org/) for guidance on which structure fits your situation.

### Q6: Where can I find sample bylaws or operating agreements for a Tennessee worker cooperative?

**A:** While Tennessee does not provide state-specific templates, these resources offer adaptable documents:
- [DAWI Resources](https://institute.coop/)
- [ICA Group Framework for Democratic Control](https://becomingemployeeowned.org/learn/structure/llc/)
- [Sustainable Economies Law Center](https://www.theselc.org/)
- [Southeast Center for Cooperative Development](https://www.co-opsnow.org/) may provide assistance through their Co-op Academy

Have any template reviewed by a Tennessee attorney to ensure compliance with state law.

### Q7: Do I need workers' compensation insurance for a worker cooperative in Tennessee?

**A:** Tennessee requires employers with five or more employees to carry workers' compensation insurance. Even in worker cooperatives, worker-owners are typically considered employees for workers' compensation purposes. Some exemptions exist for certain small businesses, but coverage is strongly recommended for all worker cooperatives.

### Q8: What are the new Tennessee tax incentives for employee ownership starting in 2026?

**A:** [SB 40/HB 1047](https://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/114/Fiscal/SB0040.pdf) creates excise tax credits for businesses converting to employee ownership:
- **Effective:** Tax years January 1, 2026 through December 31, 2030
- **Eligible structures:** ESOP, Employee Ownership Trust (EOT), or Worker-Owned Cooperative (WOC)
- **Benefits:** Tax credits cover portion of conversion costs; exemption from business tax
- **Timing:** Credits realized in the year conversion is complete

This makes Tennessee one of the states actively incentivizing employee ownership transitions.
