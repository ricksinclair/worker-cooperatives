# Governance and Bylaws for Worker Cooperatives

A practical guide to building democratic governance structures that work.

---

## Why Governance Matters

Your worker cooperative's governance structure is the foundation of democratic ownership. Good governance ensures that every worker-owner has a meaningful voice while allowing the business to make timely decisions and thrive.

Without clear governance:
- Decisions become chaotic or dominated by informal power dynamics
- Conflicts escalate without resolution paths
- Member rights remain unclear or unenforced
- The cooperative risks devolving into what some call a "tyranny of structurelessness"

With strong governance:
- Decisions are transparent and legitimate
- Accountability flows in all directions
- Conflicts get resolved fairly
- The cooperative can scale while maintaining its democratic character

## Core Governance Philosophy

Worker cooperative governance rests on three pillars:

### 1. Democratic Control
Members govern the cooperative through one-member, one-vote decision-making. Unlike conventional corporations where votes are tied to capital contribution, cooperatives tie governance to personhood. Your voice matters because you work here, not because of how much you invested.

### 2. Accountability
Those who hold power answer to those who granted it. Elected councils answer to the membership. Managers answer to the board. This creates a feedback loop that keeps leadership aligned with member interests.

### 3. Transparency
Members need information to make good decisions. Financial reports, meeting minutes, strategic plans, and policy changes should be accessible to all worker-owners.

## Core Governance Bodies

Most worker cooperatives use a tiered governance structure similar to conventional corporations, but with workers as the voting constituency. The [Mondragon Corporation](https://www.mondragon-corporation.com/en/) provides a well-tested model with over 65 years of refinement.

### General Assembly (Membership Meeting)

The General Assembly is your cooperative's highest authority. It comprises all worker-members and typically meets annually or semi-annually.

**Responsibilities:**
- Approve annual financial reports and business plans
- Elect the Governing Council (board of directors)
- Decide major strategic questions (mergers, significant investments, bylaw changes)
- Set broad policy direction

**Key feature:** One member, one vote. This is the cornerstone of cooperative democracy.

### Governing Council (Board of Directors)

The Governing Council is your elected oversight body, typically 5-12 members depending on cooperative size.

**Responsibilities:**
- Set policy and strategic direction between General Assemblies
- Appoint and oversee the General Manager
- Approve budgets and major expenditures
- Ensure the cooperative operates according to its bylaws and values

**Meeting frequency:** Usually monthly or bi-monthly.

**Term structure:** Many cooperatives stagger terms so only half the board is up for election at any time, preserving institutional memory.

### Officers

Most cooperatives require at minimum:

- **President/Chair:** Presides at meetings, represents the cooperative externally, links communication between management and members
- **Secretary:** Maintains records including policies, meeting minutes, and membership lists; serves as official custodian of bylaws
- **Treasurer:** Oversees finances, prepares budgets, ensures accurate financial reporting

Officers are typically elected by the board from among board members, though some cooperatives elect officers directly by membership vote. In smaller cooperatives, one person may hold multiple officer roles.

### Management

Professional managers handle daily operations. This is a critical distinction: worker-owners set direction; managers execute it.

**Responsibilities:**
- Full authority over day-to-day operations
- Implement strategy set by the board
- Report regularly to the Governing Council

This separation means time-sensitive decisions do not wait for a vote. Your cooperative can move as fast as any conventional business while maintaining democratic oversight.

### Optional Bodies

Larger cooperatives often add specialized councils:

**Social Council**
- Focuses on working conditions, compensation, safety, and benefits
- Advisory role to management and the Governing Council
- Provides a channel for workplace concerns outside the governance hierarchy

**Watchdog Council (Audit Committee)**
- Monitors financial integrity
- Reviews accounts and compliance
- Reports directly to the General Assembly

## Voting Mechanisms

### One Member, One Vote

This principle is non-negotiable in worker cooperatives. Every worker-owner gets exactly one vote regardless of tenure, hours worked, or capital contribution.

### Quorum Requirements

Quorum is the minimum percentage of members that must be present for decisions to be valid.

**Typical thresholds:**
- Worker cooperatives: 50-70% of members (higher than consumer coops because membership is smaller and more engaged)
- Board meetings: Majority of directors then in office

Set your quorum based on:
- Total membership size
- How difficult it is to gather your group
- The risk of decisions being made by small, unrepresentative groups

### Voting Thresholds

**Simple Majority (50% + 1)**
- Routine business decisions
- Most elections
- Standard policy changes

**Supermajority (66-75%)**
- Bylaw amendments
- Mergers or acquisitions
- Major asset sales
- Member termination
- Dissolution

**Consensus or Near-Consensus (80-100%)**
- Some cooperatives use consensus for foundational decisions
- Works best in smaller cooperatives with strong shared culture

**Best practice:** Be specific in your bylaws about which decisions require which threshold. Ambiguity causes conflict.

## Bylaws Essentials

Your bylaws are your cooperative's constitution. They should be comprehensive enough to govern the organization but flexible enough to allow adaptation.

### What Bylaws Should Cover

1. **Name and Purpose**
   - Legal name of the cooperative
   - Mission and purpose statement
   - Cooperative principles the organization follows

2. **Membership**
   - Who is eligible for membership
   - How to become a member (application, probationary period, buy-in)
   - Member rights and responsibilities
   - Grounds and process for termination

3. **Meetings**
   - When and how General Assemblies are called
   - Notice requirements
   - Quorum requirements
   - How members can call special meetings

4. **Governance Structure**
   - Board composition and size
   - Officer roles and responsibilities
   - Term lengths and limits
   - Election procedures
   - Removal procedures

5. **Decision-Making**
   - What requires membership vote vs. board vote
   - Voting thresholds for different decision types
   - Proxy voting rules (if allowed)

6. **Financial Provisions**
   - Fiscal year
   - Patronage allocation formula
   - Capital account provisions
   - Reserve requirements

7. **Amendment Process**
   - How bylaws can be changed
   - Notice requirements for proposed amendments
   - Voting threshold for passage

### Drafting Tips

- **Start with templates, not a blank page.** The [Democracy at Work Institute](https://institute.coop/resources/sample-worker-cooperative-bylaws) offers free sample bylaws you can customize.
- **Keep it at the governance level.** Operational details belong in policies, not bylaws.
- **Make amendment possible but deliberate.** Too easy and your foundation is unstable; too hard and you cannot adapt.
- **Consult a lawyer.** Templates are starting points, not substitutes for legal advice tailored to your state and situation.

## Operating Agreements for LLC-Structured Cooperatives

If your cooperative is structured as an LLC rather than a cooperative corporation, you will use an Operating Agreement instead of (or in addition to) bylaws.

### Why Choose an LLC?

- Greater flexibility in governance structure
- Available in all states (cooperative corporation statutes vary)
- Can elect how to be taxed (partnership, S-corp, or C-corp)
- Simpler formation in some jurisdictions

### Key Provisions for Cooperative LLCs

Your Operating Agreement must explicitly establish cooperative principles since LLC law does not assume them:

- **Democratic control:** One member, one vote (not capital-weighted)
- **Patronage-based returns:** Profits distributed based on labor contribution, not investment
- **Membership criteria:** Who qualifies as a worker-member
- **Capital accounts:** How individual equity is tracked

### Templates Available

The [Sustainable Economies Law Center](https://www.theselc.org/templates) offers bilingual (English/Spanish) operating agreement templates, including an accessible version with illustrations. The [Democracy at Work Institute](https://institute.coop/bylaw-and-operating-agreement-templates) provides templates for LLCs taxed as partnerships or corporations.

**Caution:** An LLC calling itself a cooperative without proper governance provisions is, legally and practically, not a cooperative. Ensure your Operating Agreement actually establishes democratic control.

---

## Membership Classes

Some cooperatives have multiple membership classes, especially multi-stakeholder cooperatives.

### Common Class Structures

**Single-class (most worker coops):** All worker-owners in one class with equal rights.

**Multi-stakeholder classes:**
- Worker-members (employees)
- Consumer-members (customers)
- Producer-members (suppliers)
- Investor-members (non-voting capital contributors)

### Rules for Multiple Classes

- Each class can have different patronage calculation methods
- Patronage calculations must be equitable among members within the same class
- Voting rights may differ by class, but worker control should remain primary

**Example:** Eroski, the retail arm of Mondragon, operates as a hybrid consumer-worker cooperative where both workers and consumers hold membership.

## Patronage and Profit Distribution

Unlike conventional corporations, cooperatives distribute surplus based on patronage (use of the cooperative), not capital ownership.

### How Patronage Works in Worker Cooperatives

Patronage is typically calculated based on:
- Hours worked
- Base compensation earned
- Tenure
- Or another formula specified in your bylaws

### Allocation Methods

Annual surplus is typically allocated:
- **Collective reserves (20-45%):** Retained earnings for business stability and growth
- **Individual capital accounts (45-70%):** Credited to personal member accounts, paid out on departure or retirement
- **Community/educational funds (5-10%):** Contributions to the broader cooperative movement and community

### Cash vs. Equity Patronage

- **Cash patronage:** Direct distribution of profits
- **Equity patronage:** Additional shares or capital account credits
- **Qualified allocations:** At least 20% paid in cash; member recognizes full amount as taxable income
- **Non-qualified allocations:** Cooperative pays tax now; member pays on redemption

Consult with an accountant familiar with cooperative taxation to structure this correctly.

## Conflict Resolution Mechanisms

Every cooperative needs clear procedures for handling disputes before they escalate.

### Tiered Resolution Process

**Level 1: Direct Communication**
Encourage parties to resolve issues directly when possible. Many cooperatives provide training in nonviolent communication and conflict resolution.

**Level 2: Peer Mediation**
A neutral member or committee facilitates discussion between parties. This keeps resolution internal and preserves relationships.

**Level 3: Formal Grievance Procedure**
When informal approaches fail:
1. Written grievance submitted to designated body (often the Social Council or a Grievance Committee)
2. Investigation and fact-finding
3. Proposed resolution communicated to all parties
4. Appeal process to the board if needed

**Level 4: External Mediation/Arbitration**
For intractable disputes, bring in a neutral third party. Specify in your bylaws whether arbitration decisions are binding.

### Key Principles

- **Procedural fairness:** Consistent, transparent processes
- **Timeliness:** Establish deadlines for each stage
- **Documentation:** Keep records of proceedings
- **Proportionality:** Match response to severity of issue

Research shows that having a formal grievance procedure reduces turnover by giving members "voice" options beyond simply quitting.

## Amending Governance Documents

Your cooperative will need to update its governance as it grows and circumstances change.

### Typical Amendment Process

1. **Proposal:** Board or specified number of members proposes amendment
2. **Notice:** Written notice to all members (typically 10-30 days before vote)
3. **Discussion:** Opportunity for member input, often at a meeting
4. **Vote:** Supermajority (usually 2/3 or 3/4) of members present at a properly noticed meeting
5. **Documentation:** Secretary records amendment and updates official bylaws

### Best Practices

- Require supermajority for bylaw changes to ensure broad support
- Distinguish between bylaws (fundamental governance) and policies (operational details that can change more easily)
- Review bylaws periodically (every 3-5 years) to ensure they still fit your cooperative
- Do not make amendments so difficult that the cooperative cannot adapt

## Summary

Strong governance is what makes a worker cooperative more than just a business with profit-sharing. It is the mechanism through which workers exercise genuine ownership and control.

The key elements:
- **General Assembly** as the supreme decision-making body
- **Governing Council** for ongoing oversight
- **Professional management** for daily operations
- **One member, one vote** as the non-negotiable principle
- **Clear bylaws** that everyone understands and follows
- **Conflict resolution** processes that preserve relationships

Your governance structure should be robust enough to handle hard decisions and flexible enough to evolve as your cooperative grows. Start with proven templates, adapt them to your context, and revisit them regularly.

Democratic workplaces are possible. Good governance makes them sustainable.
