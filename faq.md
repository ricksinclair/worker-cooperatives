# Frequently Asked Questions About Worker Cooperatives

Your questions answered. Whether you're exploring the idea of starting a cooperative, converting an existing business, or simply curious about how worker ownership works, this guide covers what you need to know.

---

## Getting Started

### What is a worker cooperative?

A worker cooperative is a business owned and democratically governed by its employees. Rather than outside shareholders or a single owner making decisions and collecting profits, the workers themselves collectively own the enterprise, share in governance, and divide the surplus based on their labor contribution.

Key characteristics include:

- **Worker ownership**: Employees hold equity stakes in the business
- **Democratic governance**: Major decisions follow a one-member, one-vote principle
- **Profit sharing**: Surplus is distributed to workers based on labor contribution, tenure, or other agreed-upon formulas
- **Shared risk and reward**: Workers bear the business's financial risk alongside its benefits

Worker cooperatives operate across virtually every industry—manufacturing, retail, technology, healthcare, agriculture, professional services, restaurants, and more. [^1]

---

### How do I start a worker cooperative?

Starting a worker cooperative follows a similar path to starting any business, with additional steps for democratic structure and member governance. Here's the general process:

**1. Form your founding group**
Convene 5-15 people with mutual interest in creating a worker cooperative. Members should be available for regular meetings and able to devote substantial time to research and planning. [^2]

**2. Assess skills and assign roles**
Inventory the skill sets and experiences of the group. Determine who will handle business development, legal research, financial planning, and other tasks.

**3. Conduct market research**
Determine the viability of your business proposition. A cooperative business must be a successful *business* first—it won't survive on its cooperative structure alone. [^2]

**4. Create your business plan**
Develop both a traditional business plan and an "organization plan" detailing how you'll operate cooperatively—governance structure, decision-making processes, membership requirements, and profit distribution.

**5. Choose your legal structure**
Decide between a cooperative corporation, LLC, or other legal entity based on your state's laws and your specific needs.

**6. Incorporate and draft governing documents**
File articles of incorporation and create bylaws or an operating agreement that codifies your cooperative principles.

**7. Capitalize your business**
Secure startup funding through member investments, loans, grants, or other sources.

**[Start Your Cooperative](/start)** for a detailed step-by-step guide.

---

### How much does it cost to start a worker cooperative?

Startup costs vary dramatically by industry and scale:

- **Low end**: Smaller service businesses may need $10,000–$30,000 in startup capital
- **Mid-range**: Most cooperatives require typical small business startup costs—legal fees, registration, equipment, initial marketing, and operating expenses for the first few months
- **High end**: Manufacturing or capital-intensive cooperatives may require hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars [^3]

The actual cost depends on your industry, location, and business model. A cleaning cooperative has very different capital requirements than a manufacturing cooperative.

**Good news**: Cooperatives can pool resources among members, potentially lowering the burden on any individual. Some cooperatives start with minimal capital when workers contribute their labor ("sweat equity") rather than cash. [^3]

**Funding sources include**:
- Member buy-ins and investments
- Cooperative-friendly lenders and credit unions
- SBA loans
- Community development financial institutions (CDFIs)
- State and local cooperative development programs
- The WORK Act (2025), which provides federal grants up to $300,000–$439,200 for cooperative development [^4]

---

### Do I need a lawyer to start a worker cooperative?

**Not strictly required, but strongly recommended.** Cooperative law involves complex issues around entity formation, employment relationships, tax treatment, and governance structures. A lawyer experienced in cooperative law can help you avoid costly mistakes. [^5]

**If you can't afford a lawyer right away, free and low-cost resources exist**:

- **[Co-opLaw.org](https://www.co-oplaw.org/)** — A comprehensive legal resource library with plain-language guides and template documents for every U.S. state [^5]
- **Cooperative development organizations** — Many offer free or low-cost technical assistance (find one in your state)
- **[Sustainable Economies Law Center](https://www.theselc.org/)** — Offers "Bite-Sized Legal Guides" and legal clinics [^5]
- **Law school clinics** — Some law schools have transactional clinics that help cooperatives at no cost

**At minimum, consult a lawyer for**:
- Choosing your legal entity (LLC vs. cooperative corporation)
- Drafting articles of incorporation and bylaws
- Understanding employment law implications
- Structuring your tax treatment

**[Find Your State Guide](/states)** for state-specific legal resources and cooperative-friendly attorneys.

## Ownership & Membership

### How do workers become owners?

Workers typically become member-owners through a defined process:

**1. Candidacy period**
Most cooperatives require new workers to complete a probationary period (often 3–12 months) before becoming eligible for membership. This allows both the cooperative and the worker to assess fit. [^6]

**2. Application and approval**
The worker applies for membership. Some cooperatives automatically admit eligible workers; others require a vote by existing members.

**3. Buy-in payment**
The worker purchases a membership share. This can be paid as:
- A lump sum
- Payroll deductions over time
- "Sweat equity" (labor contribution instead of cash)
- A loan from the cooperative [^6]

**4. Education and onboarding**
Many cooperatives require new members to complete training on cooperative principles, governance, and financial literacy before or shortly after joining.

**Not all employees must become members.** Some cooperatives allow employees to remain non-members if they choose, though membership is usually encouraged. Certain positions (like seasonal workers or probationary employees) may not be eligible for membership. [^6]

---

### What's the buy-in requirement?

**There's no standard amount—each cooperative sets its own buy-in.** Amounts range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the cooperative's capital needs and industry.

**Examples**:
- Some service cooperatives have buy-ins as low as $500–$1,000
- Manufacturing cooperatives may require $3,000–$10,000 or more
- Mondragon cooperatives in Spain historically required roughly one year's salary, though this has varied [^7]

**The key principle**: Buy-ins should be accessible to workers while providing meaningful capital to the business. Many cooperatives offer payment plans or payroll deductions to make membership achievable regardless of a worker's savings.

---

### Can members sell their shares?

**Generally, no—not to outside parties.** Unlike stock in a traditional corporation, cooperative membership shares aren't traded on markets and typically cannot be sold to non-members.

When you leave, your membership share is redeemed by the cooperative at its original value (or a value determined by the bylaws). You don't sell it to someone else—the cooperative buys it back. [^8]

This is intentional: it prevents outside investors from acquiring control and ensures ownership stays with active workers.

---

### What happens when a member leaves?

When a member leaves a worker cooperative—whether through resignation, retirement, or termination—their financial stake is returned to them:

**1. Membership share return**
The cooperative redeems their membership share at its original value (or as specified in the bylaws).

**2. Internal capital account payout**
If the cooperative uses internal capital accounts (common in larger cooperatives), the member receives the balance of their account—their accumulated share of retained profits over their years of membership. [^8]

**Payout timing varies**:
- Some cooperatives pay immediately upon departure
- Others pay over time (e.g., 3–5 years) to protect the cooperative's cash flow
- Mondragon pays internal capital accounts at retirement [^7]

**Important**: The member receives their individual capital, not a share of the cooperative's total value. This prevents departures from destabilizing the business. [^8]

---

## Governance

### How are decisions made?

Worker cooperatives use **representative democracy**, similar to how corporations use boards of directors—except the "shareholders" are the workers themselves.

**The typical structure** [^9]:

| Level | Who | What They Decide | How Often |
|-------|-----|------------------|-----------|
| **General Assembly** | All members | Major strategic decisions, bylaws, elect council | Annually or semi-annually |
| **Governing Council** | Elected representatives | Policy, oversight, hire/fire management | Monthly |
| **Management** | Hired professionals | Day-to-day operations | Continuously |

**What members vote on**:
- Electing the governing council
- Major strategic changes (mergers, large investments, new business lines)
- Bylaw amendments
- Approval of annual financial statements and budgets

**What members don't vote on**:
- Daily operational decisions
- Hiring individual employees
- Supplier contracts
- Routine business matters

The key difference from traditional corporations is *who votes* (workers vs. investors), not *how often* they vote.

---

### Doesn't democracy slow things down?

**No—this is a common misconception.** Worker cooperatives don't operate by constant referendum. They use the same professional management structures as conventional businesses. [^9]

**Day-to-day operations** are handled by managers with full authority to make decisions. Time-sensitive matters don't wait for a vote any more than they would at a traditional company waiting for a board meeting.

**Mondragon's cooperatives** hold general assemblies just once or twice per year for major decisions. Their industrial cooperatives compete globally in fast-moving markets—hardly evidence that democratic governance slows them down. [^9]

**In fact, democratic governance can speed certain things up**:
- Workers are more likely to support decisions they helped make
- Less resistance to change when people have voice in the process
- Fewer surprises—workers close to operations spot problems early

---

### What if workers disagree?

Disagreement is normal and healthy. Cooperatives handle conflict through:

**Governance structures**:
- Clear decision-making procedures in bylaws
- Majority or supermajority voting for different types of decisions
- Elected councils to resolve policy disputes
- Defined roles for management vs. member decisions

**Conflict resolution processes**:
- Many cooperatives have formal grievance procedures
- Some use mediation or arbitration for serious disputes
- Social councils (like Mondragon's) provide a channel for workplace concerns [^9]

**Cultural practices**:
- Regular member meetings build communication and trust
- Training in consensus-building and collaborative decision-making
- Shared commitment to cooperative principles

The goal isn't to eliminate disagreement—it's to channel it productively. Cooperatives that invest in good governance and communication manage conflict as well as or better than traditional businesses.

---

### Who handles day-to-day management?

**Professional managers**—just like any other business.

Worker cooperatives hire managers and executives to run daily operations. These managers may or may not be worker-members themselves, depending on the cooperative's policies. [^9]

**The key difference**: Managers are accountable to an elected governing council (which represents the workers), rather than to outside shareholders. The council hires, evaluates, and can fire management.

This structure is essentially identical to a conventional corporation—except the "board" is elected by workers instead of investors.

**Large cooperatives** often have full executive teams: CEO, CFO, department heads, and multiple management layers. Mondragon's cooperatives have sophisticated management structures overseeing global operations. [^9]

---

## Money & Finances

### How do worker-owners get paid?

Worker-owners receive compensation in multiple forms:

**1. Regular wages or salary**
Like any job, worker-owners receive regular pay (hourly or salary) for their work. These wages are typically competitive with market rates and are subject to normal payroll taxes. [^10]

**2. Patronage dividends (profit sharing)**
At year-end, if the cooperative is profitable, surplus is distributed to members based on their labor contribution (often measured by hours worked or wages earned). This is called a "patronage dividend." [^10]

**3. Internal capital account credits**
Some portion of profits may be retained in the cooperative but credited to individual member accounts, building equity that's paid out when the member leaves. [^8]

**The IRS requires** that worker cooperatives pay members a "reasonable salary" subject to payroll taxes—you can't avoid payroll taxes by paying everything as patronage dividends. [^10]

**Pay ratios** in cooperatives are typically much more equitable than traditional companies:
- Average U.S. worker cooperative: 2:1 ratio (highest to lowest paid) [^11]
- Mondragon: historically capped at 6:1, now up to 9:1 in some cases [^9]
- Average U.S. corporation: 351:1 ratio [^11]

---

### How are profits distributed?

Cooperatives typically allocate annual surplus (profit) into three categories [^9]:

**1. Collective reserves** (often 20–45% of surplus)
Retained earnings that stay in the cooperative permanently—building financial stability and funding future growth. These reserves belong to no individual member.

**2. Member capital accounts** (often 45–70% of surplus)
Credited to individual members' internal capital accounts based on their labor contribution. This builds individual equity but stays in the cooperative until the member leaves.

**3. Community/education funds** (often ~10% of surplus)
Many cooperatives, following Mondragon's model, dedicate a portion to education, cooperative development, and community programs.

**Cash distributions** may also occur—immediate payouts to members. The balance between retained earnings and cash distributions depends on the cooperative's growth plans and financial needs.

---

### Can cooperatives raise outside capital?

**Yes.** The claim that cooperatives "can't raise capital" conflates governance rights with financing mechanisms. [^9]

**Cooperatives raise external capital through**:

- **Non-voting debt**: Loans and bonds that provide returns without governance rights
- **Preferred shares**: Equity-like instruments without voting power
- **Retained earnings**: Many successful cooperatives self-finance growth
- **Cooperative banks**: Institutions like Mondragon's Laboral Kutxa exist specifically to finance cooperative enterprises [^9]
- **Government programs**: Many jurisdictions offer cooperative-specific financing
- **Community development financial institutions (CDFIs)**: Mission-aligned lenders that support cooperatives
- **Revenue-based financing**: Returns tied to revenue rather than equity

**The real challenge** isn't that cooperatives *can't* raise capital—it's that the existing financial infrastructure is built around traditional equity. Venture capital and private equity expect control and unlimited upside. Cooperatives offer neither, so they must use different financing tools. [^9]

---

### Are cooperatives profitable?

**Yes.** Worker cooperatives compete successfully in the same markets as traditional businesses.

**Evidence of financial viability**:

- Mondragon generates over 11 billion euros in annual revenue across 80+ cooperatives [^9]
- U.S. worker cooperatives generate $480+ million in annual revenue collectively [^11]
- Cooperatives survive their first 6–10 years at a rate 7% higher than traditional small businesses [^12]
- In France, the three-year survival rate for worker cooperatives is 80–90%, versus 66% for all businesses [^12]

**Why cooperatives can be *more* profitable**:

- Lower turnover reduces hiring and training costs
- Worker-owners are more engaged and productive
- Better information flow between workers and management
- More equitable pay ratios reduce total labor costs at the top
- Research shows worker ownership correlates with higher productivity [^13]

---

## Legal & Taxes

### What legal structure should we use?

**The two main options**: cooperative corporation or LLC. Each has advantages depending on your situation. [^14]

**Cooperative Corporation** (recommended for most cooperatives):

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Clear legal framework for cooperative governance | Less flexible than LLC |
| Clearly qualifies for Subchapter T tax treatment | May require more formalities |
| Easier to manage as membership grows | Not available in all states |
| Can use "cooperative" in your name | Workers are employees (subject to employment taxes) |

**LLC (Limited Liability Company)**:

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| More flexible governance structure | May not qualify for Subchapter T tax benefits |
| Members may not be "employees" (relevant for immigration) | Can't use "cooperative" in name in some states |
| Simpler formation in some states | More complex as membership changes |
| Useful for undocumented workers | Less established legal precedent |

**General recommendation**: The cooperative corporation is typically the best entity for worker cooperatives unless you have specific reasons to choose an LLC (such as members who cannot be employees). Consult an attorney familiar with your state's laws. [^14]

**[Find Your State Guide](/states)** to understand your state's specific options.

---

### How are cooperatives taxed?

Worker cooperatives can elect taxation under **Subchapter T** of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides significant tax advantages. [^10]

**How Subchapter T works**:

1. **The cooperative pays wages** to worker-members (taxed normally)
2. **Profits are calculated** after wages and expenses
3. **Profits distributed to members as patronage dividends** are *deductible* by the cooperative
4. **Members pay taxes** on patronage dividends they receive
5. **Only undistributed profits** are taxed at the corporate level

**The benefit**: This avoids the "double taxation" that regular corporations face (where profits are taxed at the corporate level, then again when distributed as dividends to shareholders). [^10]

**Important requirements**:
- The cooperative must operate on a cooperative basis
- Patronage dividends must be distributed based on labor contribution, not capital investment
- Workers must receive reasonable wages (can't avoid payroll taxes)
- Proper documentation and timing of patronage allocations

**Additional tax benefit (2025)**: Worker-owners may qualify for the 20% pass-through business deduction on patronage dividends, providing additional tax savings. [^10]

**State taxes** vary by state. Some states have favorable treatment for cooperatives; others don't distinguish them from regular corporations.

---

### What's the difference between a cooperative and an ESOP?

Both are forms of employee ownership, but they work very differently. [^15]

| Feature | Worker Cooperative | ESOP |
|---------|-------------------|------|
| **Ownership** | Direct—workers own shares personally | Indirect—a trust holds shares on workers' behalf |
| **Voting** | One member, one vote | Typically proportional to shares (varies) |
| **Control** | Workers directly govern the business | Workers rarely direct how shares are voted |
| **Purchase** | Workers buy shares (buy-in) | Company funds the trust; workers don't pay |
| **Benefit timing** | Ongoing wages + annual profit sharing | Retirement benefit (like a 401k) |
| **Regulation** | State cooperative law | Federal ERISA regulations |
| **Cost to establish** | Lower | Higher (ESOP administration is complex) |
| **Best for** | Smaller businesses, startups, democratic culture | Larger businesses, succession planning |

**ESOPs** are employee benefit plans regulated like 401(k)s. Workers receive shares in retirement accounts but don't directly control the company. ESOPs work well for business owners looking to sell their company to employees while getting tax benefits.

**Worker cooperatives** are member-owned businesses with direct democratic control. Workers govern the company now, not just receive retirement benefits later.

Some companies combine elements of both. A few ESOPs (like Once Again Nut Butter) operate with cooperative-style governance. [^15]

---

## Scaling & Growth

### Can cooperatives grow large?

**Yes.** The claim that cooperatives "don't scale" is contradicted by real-world evidence. [^9]

**Large-scale cooperative examples**:

- **Mondragon Corporation** (Spain): 80,000+ employees, 80+ cooperatives, 11+ billion euros annual revenue [^9]
- **John Lewis Partnership** (UK): 80,000+ employee-partners, one of Britain's largest retailers [^9]
- **Cooperative Home Care Associates** (USA): 2,000+ worker-owners in home healthcare [^11]
- **Emilia-Romagna cooperatives** (Italy): Cooperatives account for ~30% of regional GDP [^9]
- **Eroski** (Spain): One of Spain's largest retail chains, part of Mondragon

**Why doesn't the cooperative model dominate?**

Several factors unrelated to efficiency [^9]:
- Historical path dependency—corporate law, finance, and business education developed around investor-owned models
- Financing infrastructure designed for traditional equity
- Legal frameworks that don't support cooperatives well in many jurisdictions
- Entrepreneurs seeking venture capital adopt structures VCs expect

The question isn't "why aren't cooperatives bigger?" but "given all structural disadvantages, why do they persist and thrive at all?"

---

### How do cooperatives hire employees?

Cooperatives can and do hire employees who aren't members. The relationship between employment and membership varies [^6]:

**Common approaches**:

**1. Membership track**
New hires start as employees. After a probationary period (3–12 months), eligible employees can apply for membership. The goal is for all workers to eventually become members.

**2. Tiered workforce**
Some positions (seasonal, part-time, certain roles) may never be eligible for membership. This is more common in larger cooperatives with diverse workforce needs.

**3. Universal membership**
All workers are or become members. No permanent non-member employees.

**Important considerations**:
- Non-member employees don't vote or share in profits the same way
- Having a large non-member workforce can create a two-tier system
- Mondragon has faced criticism for non-member workers at international subsidiaries [^9]

**Best practice**: Most cooperative advocates encourage moving toward universal membership while recognizing that probationary periods and some flexibility are necessary.

---

### Can cooperatives have managers?

**Absolutely.** Worker cooperatives hire professional managers just like any business. [^9]

**What managers do in a cooperative**:
- Run day-to-day operations
- Make operational decisions
- Hire and supervise workers
- Implement strategy set by the governing council
- Report to the elected council (similar to reporting to a board)

**Can managers be members?**
Yes—in most cooperatives, managers are also worker-members with the same voting rights as everyone else. Some cooperatives hire non-member managers, particularly for specialized roles.

**How is this different from traditional companies?**
The manager's authority comes from the workers (through the elected council) rather than from outside shareholders. Managers serve at the pleasure of the worker-owners, not distant investors.

**Large cooperatives** have full management hierarchies: CEOs, CFOs, department heads, supervisors. Mondragon's cooperatives have sophisticated management structures running global operations. [^9]

---

## Common Concerns

### What if the business fails?

Cooperatives can fail—they're businesses operating in competitive markets, not magical entities immune to economic reality.

**When Fagor Electrodomésticos** (Mondragon's largest industrial cooperative) failed in 2013, it demonstrated both the limits and strengths of the cooperative model [^9]:

- The cooperative declared bankruptcy—worker ownership didn't prevent failure
- But other Mondragon cooperatives absorbed most displaced workers
- The federation's solidarity mechanisms prevented abandonment

**What happens financially**:
- Members may lose their buy-in investment
- Internal capital account balances may be partially or fully lost
- Members have limited liability (like shareholders in a corporation)—personal assets beyond their investment are protected

**Cooperative advantages in downturns**:
- Cooperatives are more likely to reduce hours across the board rather than lay off workers [^11]
- Profit-sharing flexibility means labor costs can adjust to revenue
- Worker commitment often leads to creative problem-solving
- Research shows cooperatives have higher survival rates than traditional businesses [^12]

---

### Are workers qualified to run a business?

**This argument proves too much—it would also argue against shareholder voting in public companies.** Most shareholders lack operational expertise too. [^9]

**The answer is delegation**:
- Cooperatives hire professional managers for expertise
- Elected councils provide oversight (like a board of directors)
- Workers vote on broad direction, not supply chain logistics

**Workers bring unique advantages**:
- Direct knowledge of operations, customers, and problems
- Closer oversight of management (they see what's actually happening)
- Vested interest in long-term success

**Successful cooperatives invest in member education**:
- Mondragon operates its own university [^9]
- Many cooperatives provide ongoing training in business, finance, and governance
- Financial literacy programs help members understand the business

---

### Why aren't there more cooperatives?

If cooperatives work, why don't we see more of them? Several factors explain their relative scarcity: [^9]

**Structural barriers**:
- **Financing infrastructure**: Venture capital, private equity, and banks are designed for traditional equity
- **Legal frameworks**: Many jurisdictions lack well-developed cooperative law
- **Business education**: MBA programs teach investor-owned models almost exclusively
- **Professional networks**: Lawyers, accountants, and advisors often lack cooperative expertise

**Path dependency**:
- Modern corporate law developed around investor-owned models
- Financial markets evolved to serve traditional equity
- Entrepreneurs adopt structures that funders expect

**Awareness and culture**:
- Most people have never heard of worker cooperatives
- "Starting a business" defaults to traditional ownership models
- Workers may not realize ownership is an option

**The good news**: These barriers are falling. Awareness is growing, cooperative development organizations are expanding, and new financing mechanisms are emerging. U.S. worker cooperatives have grown 30% since 2019. [^11]
